The one and the other, once very finely ground on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, after having crushed them dry well & beaten in the <tl>mortar</tl>, I mixed as much of one as the other, and having reworked them together on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, & passed them through a <tl>double sieve</tl> or through the <tl>sleeve of a shirt</tl> to mix them even better, I put them in <tl><m>paper</m></tl> & put them on a <tl><m>marble</m></tl> in a <env>cellar</env>. After one <ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms>, they had been been moistened enough by themselves without dampened them further, because <m>rock salt</m>, like all other <m>salts</m>, dissolves <env>in dampness</env>. I molded very neatly with it, because both were very finely ground. They want to be <del><fr>f</fr></del> humid enough to release well.</div></div><div id="p088v_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Mineral sand</h2>
It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it must be in one piece, & as if taken from a <env>quarry</env> or <env>rock formation</env>, & the deeper one takes it from, the better. The signs of its goodness is that it is thus amassed, and that when removing in the form of <m>rock</m>, it comes out in lumps & <del><fr>qu</fr></del> pieces which demonstrates its bond, & that it is not too lean.</div><div data-layout="center">However, it should <sn>break apart between your <tl><bp>hands</bp></tl></sn> & have very small <del><fr>men</fr></del> & delicate grains & of the same nature. If it is not delicate enough, you can pass & grind it finely, either through <m>water</m>, or through a <tl>sieve</tl>, <del>& when it</del> or on the <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, & in this way, from <del><fr>sil</fr></del> leanness they become fat & well bound. You can mold with it in a <del><fr>sa</fr></del> <tl>frame</tl> or in a <fr>noyau</fr> without <m>cloth waste</m>, & try it with <m>lead</m>, for if with this one it does not become porous & casts neatly, it will also behave well with <m>copper</m>. Some say that the <m>fat sands</m> do not want the <m>metal</m> to be cast too hot. <pro>Artisans who work on big works</pro> & to save time, do not need to grind & seek the curiosities of <m>artificial sands</m>, benefit from seeking some ready made in <env>nature</env>, which has the finest grain possible, & for small works, they only pass it only through a <tl>sieve</tl>. But those who work in small works, finely grind it  & grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of it.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">The <m><fr><pa>bled</pa> orb√®re</fr></m> makes a tawny powder, very delicate & very soft, which once mixed could <del>mix</del> mold very neatly.

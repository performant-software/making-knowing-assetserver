One needs to make a layer of <m><fr>batture</fr></m>, which is made <del>of well cooked honey & <m>turpentine</m></del> of <m><fr>colle forte</fr></m> soaked for 24 <ms>hours</ms> in <m>water</m> then gently brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little <m>honey</m> to soften it, & make it boil all together. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in <m>oil</m>, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also serve to make a ground layer for <m>gold</m>. <m>Water of alum</m> also keeps <m>oil</m> from running.</div></div><div id="p010v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Ground layer for <m>gold leaf</m> on <m>parchment</m> or <m>paper</m></h2>

Hard-boil <m>eggs, divide them in half & take the yolk out, & between the two halves of the white</m> put a piece of <m>ceruse</m>, & tie them together with <tl>thread</tl>. Then boil in <m>clear water</m>, & it will become entirely black, & thus the <m>ceruse</m> will be purified. Some reheat it over fire & it becomes very white.</div></div></folio></body></html>

When you make a cast of delicate animals, like <al>snakes</al>, start by casting the belly side, or the under-tail, for this side has straighter lines which are easier to rework than the back side, which is more veined and is more marked.</div></div> <div id="p164r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Repairing burrs</h2>
Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a chaple or a burin, then scrape the burrs with the side of a burin, or carefully with a small file, and rub with <m>willow coals</m> and small brushes. Continue, also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.</div></div> <div id="p164r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Leaded</m> <m>silver</m></h2>
A lot of <sup><m>silver</m></sup> is wasted because of the <m>lead</m> which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the <m>charcoal</m> which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt <m>silver coins</m>, like reals and others, and make them into ingots prior to casting <al>lizards</al> or <al>animals</al>, for it comes out better. I cleanly molded a small, <m>silver</m> <al>viper</al>, like in the first <sup>recipe above</sup>. And at the end of the line of 4 <m>reals</m> (of 20 S of <pl>Spain</pl>), and one <m>coin</m> of 20 S from <pl>France</pl>.</div></div> <div id="164r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Blowing</h2>
When you smelt <m>silver</m> and <m>gold</m> do not blow too hard or with force, because the <m>charcoal</m> will become spent and the crucible will sink and, potentially, spill over. But when your mold is ready, blow strongly in order to properly heat the <m>silver</m> or <m>gold</m>. When all are melted it is necessary to blow over the top with a small bellows, doing the same for <m>gold</m>, for it removes and reduces the smoke.</div></div></folio></body></html>

There is none better than the one you have used to mold, that is to say lumps from your molds.  But you need to choose some of the better recooked ones.</div></div><div id="p147v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Crucible</h2> 
Beware that it should be three fingers away from the mouth of the bellows and that the aforesaid bellows is positioned underneath the bottom of the crucible, otherwise it will cool it down.</div></div> <div id="p147v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Latten</m> casting</h2> 
I have taken the one you find in <m>latten</m> skillets, which have been beaten and forged quite thinly.  Having well-heated it, I threw in two or three grains, like beads of <m>sal ammonicac</m>.  This will clarify it like a mirror, having turned very white from all the heating, I threw in it some crushed raw and pure <m>calamine</m>.  The I casted it in its very red mold.

Because it has become crusty I cooked it again, which to means to say, I reddened it, and left it to cool, then put it in <m>bleach</m>, made partly with raw <m>tartar</m> and half of common <m>salt</m>.

You will be able to read and write quite far from the candle if you set it behind the candle and turn the concave face towards you. If you put the mirror at the far end of a table with a candle on it, it will reflect two lights on the table for you. To see what is happening in a street, shut the window, or the more you can shut the better, make a hole in the bottom <sup>pane</sup>, the size of your <ms><bp>little finger</bp></ms>, perfectly round all the way through. Then apply a sheet of paper onto the window and let the middle of the sheet be over the hole. Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole and of the same size. Then turn the concave face of the mirror towards the hole, and anyone passing by in the street will be reflected on the sheet of paper. Do the same with the pierced door of a closed room. You can make wavy <sup>mirrors</sup> and triangular ones, such as are described by Ptolemy and Archimedes. The concave sort can also set fire to straw or light a candle from afar, using the sun. By reverberating fire too, it can provide warmth.</div> </div><div id="p005v_a1"><div data-layout="center"><h2>For bronzing in yellow and white</h2>

These are for tracing what you want to draw on <m>stones</m> & engrave, & when these <tl>points</tl> are fatty & cannot bite, one needs to rub them <m>diamond</m> against <m>diamond</m>.

But when the polish is taken off, it bites easily.</div></div><div id="p011v_5"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Polishing a <tl><m>copper</m> wheel</tl></h2>
Instead of polishing your <m>stone</m>, it is necessary to remove the grease by rubbing the flesh side of a piece of <m>leather</m> <sup>on the <tl>wheel</tl></sup>, all while spinning the <tl>wheel</tl> if you have not worked on it in a long time.</div></div></folio></body></html>

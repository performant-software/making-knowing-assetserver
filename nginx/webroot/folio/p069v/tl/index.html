But one ought to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been used. For it dries out after having been cast several times & is lean & has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any thickness, it is necessary that your substance of <m>copper</m> be very hot so that it penetrates & runs.  Some mix in <m>lead</m> with the <fr>fonte</fr>, but it is for large works & not for small ones.</div><div data-layout="center"><m>Sand from <al>oxen</al> feet twice-burned & finely ground</m> melts more neatly with <m>copper</m>, & without a <fr>chappe</fr>, than sand that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and <del><fr>f</fr></del> with a thickness as delicate as a <tl>knife</tl> blade or a <tl>card</tl>.

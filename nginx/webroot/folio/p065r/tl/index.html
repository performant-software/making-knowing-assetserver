 Because blacks make in different colors, some a reddish black, others tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which tend towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in <m>oil</m>, for shadow, especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very strongly ground <m>jet</m>, which you will mix with a little <m><add>yellow</add> ochre</m> & <m>lead white</m>. Or else, after you have ground your <m>lead white</m> <del><fr>bro</fr></del> and <del>clean <fr>p</fr></del> gathered it with the , grind the <m>jet</m> into it. Thus it will be more desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some black of <gap>, a little <m>sap-green</m> & <m>bistre</m>, & you will have a perfect shadow for women in <m>distemper</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">The powder of <m><pa><fr>orber√©</fr>grain</pa></m> is darker than <m>umber</m> & when you lack <m>umber</m>, the said powder will do, but it does not have body.</div></div><div id="p065r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Flesh color</h2>
You must know well the mixing of colors & the appropriate shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note & observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise, as if going from <del><fr>l<exp>ett</exp>re a ga</fr></del> right to left like , and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.</div></div><div id="p065r_3"><div data-layout="center">  <h2><tl>Mirror</tl></h2>
When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a <tl><m><fr>cristallin</fr></m> <tl>mirror</tl></tl>, which represents well after nature, and in which <del>it</del> you will see if your shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a <tl>candle</tl>, for <env>firelight</env> will make the shadows reddish. The <pro>painter</pro> also teacher himself with the <tl>mirror</tl>, for he sees in it what the natural can do.</div></div><div id="p065r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Greasy colors</h2>
If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered colors have penetrated, it means that this part is greasy, & that the second colors one layers on would not take on the dry <sup>layer</sup>, unless you rub this part with <m>soap</m> or breathe on it, because the humidity will make the colors take.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">One cannot layer <m>oil</m> on cut <m>paper</m> & model as in <m>distemper</m> because the colour would run. Thus,  to <m>gild</m> with <m><fr>or mat</fr></m>, one needs to pounce & then layer the <m>gold color</m> with the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">All greasy colors, such as <m>ceruse</m> and <m>minium</m>, <m>massicot</m>, <m>ochre</m>, <m>lead white</m> are good for making gold color.</div><div data-layout="center"> <div data-layout="left-bottom">Any color or thing that thickens when <m>water</m> is put with it when it is being ground has body. But those that lack it, such as <m><fr>cristallin</fr></m>, <m>lake</m> & become clear.</div></div></folio></body></html>

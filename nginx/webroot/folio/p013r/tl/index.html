But because this total whiteness did not respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in a <m>brick</m> of the exact size of the thing & put it inside. Then I reddened two <tl><pro>glassmaker</pro>'s solders</tl>, & as they were red, I presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I got the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a <tl><m>diamond</m> point</tl>, and I polished it with <tl><m><al>hog</al> bristles</m></tl> and <tl><m>tripoli</m></tl>.

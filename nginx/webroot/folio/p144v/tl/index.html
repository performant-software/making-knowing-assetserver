Then, with a roll of <m>clay</m> placed on the middle of the back of the <al>turtle</al>, as you can see, and at the widest place, divide your mold. Next, <m>oil</m> with your <m>oiling</m> brush half the half of the shell you want to mold. If you sand is a bit thick, temper your sand with <m>warm water</m>, so that without burning yourself you can put your finger in it without burning it. And before casting it, rub the shell with <m>spirits</m>. And then cast your sand and let it take hold.  And note that all things that have shells, or that are hard, or do not yield as <al>snakes</al> and <al>lizards</al> do, must be <m>oiled</m> to come out cleanly. The things that yield do not need this. <m>Warm water</m> means that the tempered sand sits better on the <m>oil</m>, which otherwise would not work.  With the half <al>turtle</al> having been thusly molded, separate it with its mold from its <m>clay</m> base, which you will put aside to use when needed. Then clean your half-mold, join it and flatten it like for the others. But because there will be the roll of <m>clay</m>, the half mold will have more than just half the <al>turtle</al> in it, cut and crop cleanly the excess <sup>clay</sup> and clean everything well with the brushes.  Then at the top of the edge of the mold on the side where it is cut, at the halfway mark, make two notches as you have done with other molds. And flip the <al>turtle</al> on its base, as it was, and secure the two legs that are not molded with <m>iron</m> pins and fill the empty areas around it, up to the edge of the top shell with some <m>clay</m>. Then place the circle around it and place a roll of <m>clay</m> on the first mold, a bit above the notches. And having <m>oiled</m> the first half-mold and its notches and the shell of the <al>turtle</al>, and having also sprinkled it with <m>spirits</m>, warm your <m>water</m>, temper your sand with a bit of <m>salt water</m>, <m>ammoniac</m>, and the aforesaid <m>hot water</m>, make your cast. Having taken hold, keep the sides of the two molds neatly together, and for each side secure the joints, which are not prone to do so naturally, with two clamps, so that when you uncover the bottom of the <al>turtle</al> the top joint does not open. Then open the side with the belly and the throat, in the same manner that you would open a <al>crayfish</al>, which is the hardest animal to mold of all animals that are molded in two parts.</div>If there is <m>crocum</m> in your sand, the joints of the molds will not join well together. </div><div data-layout="bottom">Turn to the second leaf.</div></div></folio></body></html>

Although it is said to be immortal, it is nonetheless the case that <m>white wine</m> removes its tint & turns claret-colored, & next the dried <m>flower</m> ends up white.

If the <m>oil</m> does not dry out, put in <m>massicot</m> & <m>minium</m>. There is no better <m>oil than <pa>walnut</pa></m>, for it does not dry out too soon nor too late.</div></div><div id="p063r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Casting</h2>
The <pl>Germans</pl> use <m>lead from <pl>Flanders</pl></m> because it is very soft.

One ought not to grind it with <m>water</m> alone, for that makes it die. To render it beautiful in <m>distemper</m>, some grind it with <m>vinegar</m>, but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To render it beautiful, grind it with <m>urine</m> & leave to dry. Then, whenever you like, grind it with <m>oil</m>. And after you have collected it with the <tl>spatula</tl>, before finishing to clean the <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, grind <m>stil de grain yellow</m> on it. And you will have a very beautiful green.</div></div></folio></body></html>

They take a little <m>turpentine</m> & <m>oil of turpentine or of <pa>spike lavender</pa></m> &  <m>amber pulverized</m> & passed very subtly & make as that of <m>mastic</m>, & add in to color it a little <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m> and make it reddish, and others some <m><fr>terra merita</fr></m> for yellow.</div></div><div id="p098r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Borders for a Garden</h2>
You have to work the ground, then then it with a rake, and afterwards if it is dry you must <m>wet</m> it. Then stretch a cord clean on the ground, and along its length hit the cord with the back of a pruning knife, so that the cord marks a right line. Along its length you will make holes with an <m>iron</m> stake, where you will plant rosemary, its head lopped off & cut to measure and thinned out at the foot.</div></div><div id="p098r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><pro>Locksmith</pro></h2>
To well <m>tin</m> nails and other work, they <tl>file</tl> their work very neatly. Then to clean it well & rid it of fattiness, they make it boil in <m>vinegar</m>, then they wipe it well with a <tl><m><pa>linen</pa></m></tl>. Next they heat it & pass some <m>resin</m> over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like <m>varnish</m>. This done, they melt some <m>pure & fine tin</m> in their <m>estamiere</m>, which is a little square <m>iron</m> box. And when the <m>tin</m> is well melted & moderately warm, they throw in  <m>resin</m> in to burn the filth, & then they let the <tl>head of a nail</tl> or something similar soak a little, & having remained there for seven or eight <ms><tmp>pauses</tmp></ms>, they take it out and shake it, hitting the top with an <tl><m>iron</m></tl> to make the <m>tin</m> that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a <tl>small stick wrapped in <m>tow</m></tl>. And if it is not well <m>tinned</m>, you will hit it hot with a piece of <m>resin</m> & do as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow, which is a sign that the <m>tin</m> is the right temperature. But it becomes blue if the <m>tin</m> is too hot. Things <del><fr>t</fr></del> thus <m>tinned</m> are durable & are not undone like <m>tinning done in leaf</m>, thus at the end of a <tmp>year</tmp> they can be clarified & renewed by heating & rubbing them.</div><div data-layout="center"><pro>Leadsmiths</pro> say that making a <al>lizard</al> die in the melted <del><fr>il des</fr></del> <m>tin</m> makes the <m>tinning</m> become very golden.

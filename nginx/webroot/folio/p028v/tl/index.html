They think the best <m>tin</m> is the one that comes in <fr>saulmons</fr>, which has not been remelted since it came from the <env>mine</env>, because the masters remelt it <del>a</del> in <tl><fr>grilles</fr></tl>, weighing two or three <ms>lb</ms>, to easily cut it up and sell it by the piece. And in this they often mix in leftovers from <m>plates</m>, <m>soldering</m> & <m>common tin</m>. And to recognise the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their <fr>saulmons</fr> they find pieces of <m>iron</m>, stones, & similar things mixed in, to cheat on the weight. The <m>tin from <pl>England</pl></m> is so hard that the <pro>miners</pro> put in <m>lead</m> to soften it. The one that comes by way of <pl>Germany</pl> is softer. Usually, the <pro>sworn master pewterers</pro>, from <env><fr>bonnes villes</fr></env>, add 6 <ms>lb</ms> of <m>fine lead</m> <del>on</del> or  8 on a <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine tin</m>. The <pro>others, who work in the <env>countryside</env></pro>, put fifteen or twenty or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness of the <m>lead</m> <del>they</del> and its softness, they put in <m>looking-glass tin</m>, 4 <ms>lb</ms> per <ms>quintal</ms>,  When the <m>tin is fine</m>, one adds less <m>glass-looking tin</m> to it, namely 4 <ms>lb</ms> per <ms>quintal</ms>, but if the <m>tin is low quality</m>, that is to say allied with a lot of <m>lead</m>, one puts at least five or six <ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking-glass tin</m> to it.</div><div data-layout="center">If there is not a lot of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, one puts about two or three <ms>lb</ms> per <ms>quintal</ms>. One puts eight <ms>lb</ms> of <m>rosette</m>. But if there is a lot of <m>looking-glass tin</m> <del>one</del>, like 4 or 5 <ms>lb</ms>, one only puts six of <m>rosette</m>. And commonly, per <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>tin</m>, one adds x <ms>lb</ms> of both.</div></div><div id="p028v_2">

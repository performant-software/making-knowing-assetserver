You must have some <m>millet</m> soaked in order to remove the <m>chaff</m> and then clean it well. Next you must <tl>grind</tl> it again quite finely and pass through a cloth <tl>sieve</tl>. One must soak the <m>flour</m> with fresh melted <m>butter</m> and some <m>milk</m> so that it is very light, like the <m>pastry</m> to make <m>beignets</m>, and add <m>egg yolk</m> depending on the amount of <m>flour</m>, so that there are two <m>egg yolks</m> for each <m>millas</m>. Then you will put in some <m><pa>saffron</pa></m> if you want to give them a little colour.</div> <div data-layout="center">Afterwards you must have some <tl>mold</tl>s, which must be made from <m>terra<sup>cotta</sup></m>, in the shape of the bottom of the catholic hat, but it must be open at both ends. And then, having made a good fire, clean where you want to put your <m>millas</m> and then take your <tl>mold</tl>s and grease them very well so that the <m>pastry</m> does not stick to them when baked. Once you have done that, put your <tl>mold</tl>s in a place in the <tl>oven</tl> where you clean and sprinkle a bit of <m>flour</m> on the bottom and fill them with some of the aforementioned <m>pastry</m>. Then you will cover the said <tl>mold</tl>s, with a <tl>lid</tl> made like the <tl>mold</tl>, but it must be bigger and not open at the top. Then once done, you will put some <m>straw</m> on the said <tl>lid</tl> and a lot of hot <m>charcoal</m>, and set a fire around it, once done, you will open up one of them after a bit of time and will see when it is baked, it will be hard.</div></div><div id="p020r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>@<pro>Glazier</pro></h2>
<m>Glass from <pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is smoother & more even than <m>plate glass</m> and it is sturdier & more durable. But commonly it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens because the <pro>glassmakers</pro>, having made it, put it when totally hot on <m><pa>straw</pa></m>, which stains it in this way. However, this is removed with <m>varnish</m> & <m>salt</m> & other <m>drugs</m> that the  <pro>glaziers</pro> put in. <m>Glass from <pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is sold by <ms><fr>lien</fr></ms> & each <ms><fr>lien</fr></ms> is composed of three <ms>tablets</ms>. The <ms><fr>lien</fr></ms> costs usually x <cn><fr>sous</fr></cn>. <m>Plate glass</m> <del>sold in</del> is made in <pl>France</pl>, it is whiter & clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from <pl>Lorraine</pl>. It is also commonly blown & in that case, it is better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the shape of the frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very evenly.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom"><m>Plate glass</m> is sold by <ms><fr>paniers</fr></ms>. Every <ms><fr>panier</fr></ms> contains 24 <ms>plates</ms> that are commonly sold at x or twelve <cn>lb</cn>.</div></div> </folio></body></html>

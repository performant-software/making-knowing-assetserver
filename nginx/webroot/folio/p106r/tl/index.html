<m>Asphaltum <del>is</del>, which is found in <pl>Germany</pl></m>, is the most excellent sand one can find for molding in a <tl>frame</tl>, because it is appropriate for <m>silver</m> & for <m>gold</m>, & the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. One molds in it very thinly & finely.</div></div><div id="p106r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><add>Making <m>gold</m> run</add> for casting</h2>
Because <m>gold</m> cools down very quickly, one ought to give it a mix when<del>melted <fr>q</fr></del> it is well melted which maintains the heat. <m>Sublimate</m> softens it nicely. But, because it goes up in smoke, it does not continue to help. Therefore mix this composition when you want to cast:  <m>sal ammoniac</m>, the best <m><fr>verdet</fr></m> that you can find, a little <m>borax</m> & <m>saltpeter</m> <del><add><fr>qui li</fr></add></del>. And this, by keeping it heat, it will come out neatly. <add><m>Saltpeter</m> clarifies it & <del><fr>p</fr></del> heats it. But the most important thing in this mixture is the <m><fr>verdet</fr></m>, which has to be good. This mixture softens the <m>gold</m> <del><fr>qui</fr></del> so much that it becomes treatable like <m>lead</m>, even <m>fine gold</m>.</add></div><div data-layout="center">For sand for molding flowers & leaves & delicate things, mix in <m>well-ground raw plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> & <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m>.</div><div data-layout="center">To moisten sands, <m><fr>eau de vye</fr></m> is excellent, for it grinds the <m>sand</m> finely & evaporates <del><fr>que</fr></del> when one reheats the <tl>frames</tl>.</div><div data-layout="center"><m>Sal ammoniac water</m> is very good, is excellent for moistening <m>sands</m>, but for lots of <m>water</m> one only needs a little <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</div><div data-layout="center">A lump of <m>iron</m>, for lack of <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m>, is <del><fr>exce</fr></del> good for <m>gold</m>.</div><div data-layout="center">The <al>snakes</al> or <al>lizards</al> you want to mold should not be kept for a long time, for if they are alive, they get thin, and if they are <del>dry <fr>il</fr></del> dead, they wither.</div><div data-layout="center"><m>Plaster of <pl>Paris</pl></m> is as firm as <m>stone</m> & very good.

A sign of the one that is close to perfection is that it is hard & made of lustrous grains nearing the shape of <m>sugar</m>.

<m>Ceruse</m> & <m>lead white</m> is not appropriate for polished white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for <m>or mat</m> that is made with <m>oil</m> by mixing it with yellow <m>ochre</m> & <m>mine</m> <del><fr>p</fr>o</del> & by tempering all of it with <m>oil</m>. And this <m>or mat</m> thus applied keeps <env>in the rain</env> like <m>gilded leadwork</m> & similar things. Therefore for <m>burnished gold</m> take <m>good chalk, quite white, well ground</m>, & soaked with <m>distemper glue</m>, & make four layers of it, one after the other, on the <m>wood</m>. And once the last is dry, rub it with <m><pa><fr>prele</fr></pa></m>, which is a plant otherwise called <m><pa>horsetail</pa></m>, to render it well polished. Next take <m>fine <pl>Armenian </pl>bole</m> & <m>sanguine</m>, as much of one as of the other, <m><al>lamb </al>tallow</m> as large as a <m><pa>bean</pa></m> or a <m><pa>pea</pa></m> depending on the quantity of <m>bole</m>, and a little of <m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m> or as much as the <m>tallow</m>, & <ms>half a <pa>walnut</pa> shell</ms> full of half-burned <m><pa>saffron</pa></m>. Some put in a little <m>candi sugar</m>. Grind all together with <m>water</m>, & apply it without <m>gum</m> or <m>glue</m>, & let it dry, & rub the place that you want to gild with a piece of white <tl>cloth</tl> to better make even, & when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that the <m>gold</m> will carry itself well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> soaked in <m>clear water</m> the place that you want to gild & immediately apply the <m>gold</m>, which you will burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in <m><fr>rouge clair</fr></m> & glaze with it <del><fr>de</fr></del>, grind <m><pl>Venice </pl>lake <fr>platte</fr></m> on <tl><m>marble</m></tl> with <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> or <m><pa>linseed</pa></m>. Once ground, mix <m>turpentine varnish or <pa>spike lavender</pa></m> & apply on the <m>gold</m> with the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>. <m><pa>Brazilwood</pa></m> & <m>lake <fr>ronde</fr></m> die. For green, temper <m>verdigris</m> with <m><pa>walnut oil</pa></m> or <m><pa>linseed</pa></m> & grind, next mix in <m>turpentine varnish and not of <pa>spike lavender</pa></m>, which is not suitable for <m>verdigris</m>. If you want to glaze with <m>azure</m>, it needs to be set on <m>burnished silver</m> and take <m><fr>azur dâ€™esmail</fr></m>, &, without grinding, temper it with <m>turpentine varnish</m> & apply it.</div></div></folio></body></html>

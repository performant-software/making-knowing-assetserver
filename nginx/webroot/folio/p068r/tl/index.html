You can make various grooved compartments & on these, paint <al>fishes</al> naturally & with color on simple <fr><m>carton</m></fr>  & if you wish, on <m>silvered</m> and burnished <m>paper</m> to represent the scales. And next, cover them with very clear <m>lantern horn</m>. You can apply the very same to other works.</div> </div><div id="p068r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Planting <pa>trees</pa></h2>
 <pa>Trees</pa> need to be planted in dry weather, &  a lot of earth gathered all around their feet, like a mound, so that the rain won't fill the holes & drown the <pa>trees</pa>.</div></div><div id="p068r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Casting</h2>
I have tried four kinds of sand for <m>lead</m> & <m>tin</m>: <m>chalk</m>, <m>crushed glass</m>, <m>tripoli</m> & <m>burnt linen</m>, all four excellent. But as for the <m>chalk</m>, it needs to be of the softest kind you can find, like <m>the <pl>Champagne</pl> one that <pro>painters</pro> use</m>. It releases very neatly, does not need to be moistened with <m>magistra</m> or anything else, but needs to be completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized. The first cast is always the neatest, however it will well withstand two or three. But there is only the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake your <tl>box mold</tl> to take new <m>powdered chalk</m> that has not yet been used for works, for the one previously used in the box mold has dried out & has no stickiness & bond like the fresh one. <m>Crushed glass</m> can be made from <m>common glass sand, however cristallin</m> is more excellent, for <m>common glass</m> contains <del><m>glass</m></del> <m>salt of saltwort</m> only, but <m>cristallin</m> contains both <m>salt of tartar</m> & <m>saltwort</m> all together, which both help fusion, the <m>glass</m> once calcined & reduced to as if to its prime substance. In order to calcine it perfectly, throw your <m>glass</m>, lumps of whichever sort, among the largest possible lit <m>charcoals</m> that you can, if you are lacking  some other <del>t</del><add>d</add>e foeu<del>t</del> violent heat source. And when it will be well red, throw it into <m>water</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle"><m>Putty</m> is considered excellent for these two <m>metals</m>.</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

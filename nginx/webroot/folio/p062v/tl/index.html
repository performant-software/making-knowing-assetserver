To become an <pro>artist</pro>, one needs to draw by <tl><bp>eye</bp></tl>, without <tl>compass</tl> or <tl>ruler</tl>. <pro>Masters</pro> do not allow <pro>apprentices</pro> to do this.</div><div data-layout="center">When the priming has been <tmp>long</tmp> done, it becomes greasy. One needs to rub it with <m>ash</m> & <m>water</m>.</div></div><div id="p062v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Perspective</h2> 
To know the point, one needs to lay down a <tl>ruler</tl> over the lines, & at the intersection of these the point will be. Some make a hole at the end of their <tl>rulers</tl> to fix the point by that hole & move the <tl>ruler</tl> about. Others lay down a <tl>ruler</tl> across the panel, then on this laid-down <tl>ruler</tl> they set the <tl>tip of another ruler</tl>, which, attached to the former by way of a <tl>screw</tl>, moves about & reaches as far as necessary without losing the point. The <tl>ruler</tl> and <tl>compass</tl> without the <tl>judgement of the <bp>eye</bp></tl> cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.</div></div><div id="p062v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Panel</h2>
To draw & layer the colors, especially in <m>oil</m>, you need to hold your panel as upright as you can on the <tl>easel</tl>, for if it is slanted there is a danger that some dust & dirt might stick on it. Keep clean & without dust the place where you paint.</div></div></folio></body></html>

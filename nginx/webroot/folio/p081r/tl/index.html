One can find an excellent one <env>on the little hill</env> of <pl>Puy David</pl> near <pl>Thoulouse</pl> for <m>lead</m>, <m>tin</m> & <m>copper</m>. It does not want to be too reheated much because, drying out all at once, it loses its stickiness & burns at the first arrival of <m>metal</m>, which makes the work lumpy & not neat. It is better to reheat from a distance, rather than with a <m>straw</m> flame, which generates <del><fr>des</fr></del> some <m>filth</m>. Before filling in the <tl>box mold</tl>, you can put in the finest sand you have in a <tl>very fine <m>linen</m></tl>, & pound the medal dry and then the moistened sand that you put on top, which has more body, will grip it.</div><div data-layout="left-top"><m>Tallow</m> makes it porous.</div><div data-layout="left-top"><m>Fixed mercury</m> mixed in when one wants to cast, makes <del>metal</del> <m>lead</m> run. But if it is pure, one ought to cast very hot so that it runs, and vents.</div></div><div id="p081r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Earth</m> for molding</h2>
<m><pro>Tanner</pro>'s earth, or the one with which <pro>potters</pro> make a whitening on pots</m> to make <m>lead</m> run better on them & to prevent the <m>lead</m> from being absorbed into them, is very good for molding the cavities of things you want mold in relief. It releases better than <m>plaster</m> or <m>sulphur</m> which become hard once they have set.  For the <m>earth</m> being ready, one ought to be beat hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very large you can mould it in several parts. If you reheat it, it is necessary that it be over a closed fire. One finds this <m>earth</m> at <pl>Fosseret</pl> & in another place called <pl>Ox</pl>.</div></div><div id="p081r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Plaster</m></h2>
It is necessary that it be well heated, which you will recognize when cooking it in an <tl><m>iron</m> or <m>metal</m> skillet</tl>, you mix it with an <tl><m>iron</m> rod</tl>, & if it attaches to the <m>iron</m>, it is not heated enough, if not, it is good. The <m>water</m> with which you moisten should be a little warm & the <tl>mold</tl> made with the aforesaid <m>earth</m> also a little hot. The work of <m>plaster</m> does not last & the faces & delicate things break if one does not give a coat of <m>glue</m>.</div></div><div id="p081r_a4"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Carton</m></h2>
One ought to take <m>paper from <pl>Florence</pl></m>, which is the finest, & crush it & soak it several times & change the <m>water</m> <tmp>every day</tmp>, so that it does not smell bad, & since you will have moulded it in the cavity, put a <tl><m>linen</m></tl> over it, & from the back, rub the back of the <m>paper</m> with a <tl>tooth</tl>, as if you wanted to burnish it, and it will mould very neatly. Then <m>glue</m> the <m>cloth</m> on the back with <m>strong glue</m>. </div></div></folio></body></html>

Color your applied <m>silver leaf</m> with <m><fr>terre emerita</fr></m>, and once dry, give a coat of <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil varnish</m> and of <m>sandarac</m>.

Make your ground layer of <m>starch</m> soaked in <m>water</m> & your <m>gold</m> will burnish very well. <m>Clear starch water</m> layered on the <m>paper</m>, then dried, & repeated in this manner 3 times, is a good layer for <m>burnished gold</m> on simple <m>paper</m> & has no body.</div></div><div id="p029v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Removing stains</h2>
A good <m>eau de vie</m> takes it off if you rub your <m>cloth</m> with it.</div></div><div id="p029v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Ground layer of <m>gold</m></h2>

Take a well chosen tear of it which shows off its transparent red.

And leave it thus for <ms>a long time</ms>, because the longer it stays <del>there</del>, the more beautiful & better it will be & it will dissolve if it is good, otherwise it will become like <m>lees</m>. When you want to use it, make a small hole in the <tl>stopper of the bottle</tl> & pour a little & stopper it again each time, then apply it on <m>gold</m>.</div><div data-layout="center">The good kind of <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m> can be found in large pieces like <m><fr>torteau</fr></m><add>this one has no value and is adulterated</add> & once broken it shows on its edges scales, transparent as <del><fr>ro</fr></del> <m><fr>rouge clair</fr> enamel</m>, it is also lumpy in some parts like small <m>rubies</m>.

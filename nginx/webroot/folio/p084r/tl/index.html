It is necessary that it not be too wet for the above said reasons. Reheat little <add>by little</add>. And if, after having been molded, you leave it to dry slowly, in some <env>dry place</env>, & not over a big fire, it would be better, for when one exposes it all at once to intense heat, it swells. I believe that reheating it at the mouth of the <tl>furnace</tl>, <tmp>after you have taken the bread out</tmp>, would be well proper. One ought not complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it withstands as many castings as you wish, because it renders itself hard as <m>marble</m> & you can polish it & the <tl>mold</tl> cannot be spoiled.

The <m>sand from <pl>Thoulouse</pl></m>, which is taken, from the <env>depths of the earth, from the small hill of <pl>Puy David</pl></env>, is excellent in itself, but to make it withstand several castings, I mix it with <m>pulverized sandever</m> & moistened, which hardens it, & takes body & bond with it, & makes it withstand <del>more than five</del> as many castings as you wish. <rub>Try to moisten the <m>crushed glass</m></rub> and other <del><fr>e</fr></del> sands with the <m>waters of the above mentioned salts</m>.

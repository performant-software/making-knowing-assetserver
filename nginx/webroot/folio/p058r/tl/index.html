And at the beginning, one puts the black and umber where it is appropriate. Next, the <corr>heightening</corr> with <m>lead white</m> must not be put on the black. Flesh colors and <gap> with <m>ceruse</m> going in will yellow in five or six <tmp>months</tmp>, but <m>lead white</m> does not change.</div><div data-layout="center"><m><pl>Florence</pl> lake</m> is better than the kind from <pl>Flanders</pl> for in <pl>Florence</pl> the best dyes are made. To make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest & liveliest <m>lake</m> is the best, for the kind that contains <m><m>purpurine</m></m> & violet, by admixture of too much <m>alum</m>, makes flesh color like that of one who is very cold. That is why ladies, wanting to color their <bp>cheeks</bp>, ground <m><pl>Florence</pl> lake</m> very finely, then fill a little <tl><m><pa>cotton</pa></m></tl> with it, which they next wrap in a little <tl><m>fabric of <pl>Cambray</pl></m></tl> which is clear. And thus they pounce the <m>lake</m> on their <bp>cheeks</bp> & then, with another clean <tl><m><pa>cotton</pa></m></tl>, they soften it.</div> <div data-layout="center"><m><fr>Cristallin</fr></m> having been ground with <m>water</m> appears to <del>be</del> have body, but with <m>oil</m> it does not have any. It is ground with <m>lake</m> & with <m>asphaltum</m>, which would not dry for a <tmp>very long time</tmp> without this.</div> <div data-layout="center"><m><pa>Spike lavender</pa> oil</m> is commonly put with <m>lead white</m>, <del><fr>d</fr></del> not entirely pure but mixed with a little <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>. The said <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> would not be good for <m>lake</m> & colors that do not have body <add>for it would make them crack</add>, but with those that have body & are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.</div> <div data-layout="center"><m>Verdigris</m> and <m>orpiment</m> must first be ground with <m>urine</m> rather than thinning them with <m>oil</m>. Thus they are beautiful & do not die.</div></div></folio></body></html>

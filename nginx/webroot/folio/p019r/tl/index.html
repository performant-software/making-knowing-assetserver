There are also some other <fr>faulconneaux</fr> weighing three <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr>, and which are nine <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Their cannonball weighs half a pound. Their load is a quarter pound of <m>powder</m>. They can be loaded with a <tl>linstock</tl>, but more commonly they are loaded with a charge. The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front two. The small pieces which are under three <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> are at least three cannonballs and a twelfth of a cannonball thick at the breech, and the front thickness is sometimes reduced to get the proportion according to the length.</div><div data-layout="left-top">The strength of the piece is at the level of the <fr>tourillon</fr>, where the lighted <m>powder</m> starts.</div><div data-layout="left-top">The strength of the <fr>berche</fr> is at the <fr>maslée</fr>, behind the breech.</div><div data-layout="center">A double musket weighs 2 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and is seven <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball is a quarter of a pound or less. The breech is three cannonballs thick, and the front two. It is loaded with as much <m>powder</m> as cannonballs, to the top of the touch line, which is equivalent for such small pieces to 3 or 4 arquebus <m>powder</m> cannonballs, because if canon <m>powder</m> is used, it can be loaded five cannonballs high.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">This has to be understood as <m>iron</m> cannonballs. When a metal cannonball is fired, we overload it with a quarter of <tl><ms>linstock</ms></tl> because if a cannonball weighs 40 pounds, a metal one weights 60 pounds. This is why the sight is higher when a metal cannonball is fired. Because if an <m>iron</m> cannonball is fired directly, a metal cannonball is shot from six lines higher. A metal cannonball, mixed with <m>copper</m> to make it more brittle, is more effective at close range than the <m>iron</m> one. But an <m>iron</m> one is more effective at long range. </div><div data-layout="center">A simple musket weighs one <fr><ms>quintal</ms></fr> and is six <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. We disregard the ones that are less than two <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr>, and which usually throw lead cannonballs by its weight, and <x>concentrate on those</x> which are loaded by caliber. However, those <x>muskets</x> that can be loaded with metal or <m>iron</m> cannonballs will work better, for they will do more damage than the <m>lead ones</m>. It is loaded up to the touch line, which is 4 cannonballs thick. </div><div data-layout="center"> Arquebus à croc weighs 60 pounds, the bigger one is five <fr><ms>panel</ms>s</fr> long, it is loaded up to the touch line, which is 4 cannonballs thick; it is loaded with <m>lead</m> cannonballs, and is for house's defence. These great and small arquebuses are used for to make <fr>orgues</fr>, appropriate for an assault outside and inside.They are casted separately in order to be used in various ways.

To sow melons properly, it must be the end of a moon <x>cycle</x>, because otherwise they would sprout too many leaves and not bear much fruit. Every two fingers, make small holes with a small pickaxe and, in each, put two or three seeds. Then, take very fine <m>earth</m> and lightly fill the holes with it. Afterwards, spread the thickness of one thumb of 'havets,' that is wheat chaff, over everything, so that when the rain comes, it does not beat the earth and prevent their birth. 'Hanets' attract <al>field mice</al> that eat the seeds, and to prevent this, they must be moistened with a decoction of <m>wormwood</m>.</div></div><div id="p037v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><pro>Glass-maker</pro></h2>
Some do not lay <m>gris d'escaille</m> on the <m>glass</m> to work on it, but trace straight on the <m>glass</m> with <m>noir à huile</m>. However, it is important that the <m>wood</m> be <m>degreased</m>, because if it has even a little <m>grease</m> <x>on it</x>, the color will not take at all. And even, if the working <pro>glass-maker</pro> has a stink from his nose or his mouth, and he breathes on the <m>glass</m>, the color will not take on it. Those who came up with the invention of working in small works of softened <m>enamels</m> use only <m>azure enamel</m>, which is blue, and <m>esmail colombin</m>, which is the color of purple, which they soften with <m>rocks</m> or <m>lead glass</m>. As for yellow, they make it from <m>silver</m>, red from <m>sanguine</m>, as is said elsewhere, black and gray and shadows from <m>scale black</m>, either strong or weak, carnation from light <m>sanguine</m>. Green is made first from yellow, then they overlay <m>azure enamel</m>, either strong or weak, depending on whether they want to make it bright or dark.</div></div><div id="p037v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Yellow Amber</m></h2>
It is cut with a <tl>file</tl>, then one passes a certain <m>pulverized salt</m> across the surface, which an <pl>Englishman</pl> called <fr>desramonet</fr>. But I believe that this was <m>pulverized pumice stone</m>, for it had the harshness of <m>arène</m>. And with a taut <tl>cord</tl>, he polished his <m>amber</m>, then passed <tl><m>tripoli from <pl>Bretagne</pl></m></tl> on it with the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>; others used a piece of <tl><m>leather</m></tl> or a <tl>cane</tl>. <m>Amber</m> loses its color if an unhealthy person wears it, & becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be soaked for one <ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms> in <m>urine</m>, then boiled a little in it.</div></div></folio></body></html>

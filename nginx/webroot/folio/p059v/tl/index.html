<m>Charcoal black</m> mixed with a little <m>lead white</m> is very appropriate to make armory, mixing in a little <del>of <ill></del> <m>azure</m> if you wish. <m>Charcoal <add>black</add></m> by itself is as if bluish.</div></div><div id="p059v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Painting of <m>crêpe</m></h2>
First one needs to make the background greyish with <m>charcoal black</m> mixed with <m>lead white</m> & a little <m>azure</m>. Then, <del><fr>resu</fr></del> after it is dry, highlight with strokes & lines in <m>lead white</m>.</div></div> <div id="p059v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Folds in clothing</h2>
One needs to take care that none are made which are false, but that only that which happens naturally is imitated. A <m>thick cloth</m> hardly makes any folds, <m>taffetas</m> & <m>silk cloth</m>  make more, & <m>crêpe</m> more still. <del>Make</del> Observe which ones should go lengthwise & others across.</div></div><div id="p059v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Desiccative</h2>
<m>Lead white</m> & <m>massicot</m> are the most desiccative, nevertheless they need a good two <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. If you want to prove whether an <m>oil</m> is desiccative, temper <m>lead white</m> with it, & if it produces a crust <del>in a <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms></del> soon it means that it will dessicate.</div></div><div id="p059v_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Double layers</h2>
<m>Azures</m>, flesh tones and reds are layered twice. The others not.</div></div><div id="p059v_6"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Mending cracks in a panel</h2>
If a painted panel breaks you can <m>glue</m> it well on the reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it & repair it, it ought not to be with <m>glue </m>, which rots <env>in damp weather</env> & would swell when touched with the <m>oil</m> of the painting. But take <m>white wax</m>, which is harder than the other kind. The <m>oil</m> mixed in among the <m>wax</m> prevents it from melting <env>in the sun</env>. The <m>wax</m> ought not to be hard, but soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks & crevices with the <tl>tip of a knife</tl>, then scrape.</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

Some take 2 <ms></ms> of <m>turpentine oil</m> & <m>eau de vye</m>, a little at your discretion, because it evaporates when heated & nonetheless makes the <m>varnish</m> more desiccative. But I made it thus: I take <m>turpentine oil</m> at  discretion & put in a good bit of <m>turpentine</m>, because it remains always moist & attaches itself if one puts in too much, & <m>eau de vye</m>, & heat in a <tl>varnished bowl</tl> the said <m>oil</m>, & when it begins to be very hot, I put in some <m>subtly ground mastic</m> & around <ms>one-third</ms> of the <m>oil</m> passed through a <tl>sieve</tl> <del>l</del>, and let reheat until it is melted, which will be soon on hot <m>ashes</m>. Once all melted, try it on the <tl>knife</tl>, and if you see that it has too much body, add in a little <m>turpentine oil</m>, and if it does not have enough, add in <m>mastic</m>, and thus it well be done. And keep it well covered so that no filth gets in. When you want to make it, be careful to sort & choose the <m>mastic</m> that is white & purified of any dirt & dust & black dross. And when you wash it & dry it to render it very white & clean, it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these <m><pa>straws</pa></m> & marks, pulverised into it, will remain within the <m>varnish</m>, & when you set it on white or carnation, it will appear that they are <al>fleas</al> & blemishes. Once well chosen, pulverise it in a <tl>mortar</tl> and pass it through a <tl>very fine sieve</tl>, and next mix it in <m>oil</m>, as is said. But if you want to make it more carefully, extract a tear of <m>mastic</m>, as you know, pulverise, pass, & mix, and you will have something very singular for small works. Take heed when varnishing not to breathe on it, for this will make the <m>varnish</m> whiten & take body.</div><div data-layout="left-top">It almost dries when working.</div><div data-layout="left-top">One knows that this <m>varnish</m> does not have body enough when it does not take well on a panel in <m>oil</m> for it is like <m>water</m>. Add in therefore <m>pulverized mastic</m> & heat until it is good. This <m>varnish</m> is very white & beautiful, & does not go to your head like that of <m><pa>spike lavender</pa></m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">For some, instead of <del><fr>tour</fr></del> <m>turpentine oil</m>, put <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>, which is not as good.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">This <m>varnish</m> is laid down cold on the panel with a very clean <tl><bp>fingertip</bp></tl>, & one needs to spread it vigorously.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">The <pl>Italians</pl> scarcely varnish their paintings because they lay their paintings very thick & they are a <tmp>long time</tmp> drying on the inside, though on top they make a dry skin & crust.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">One lays the <m>varnish</m> with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> so as to lay it thin, because when thick, it yellows.</div></div><div id="p097v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>To work nearby</h2>
It is a strange thing that the workers in this craft can only work if they have good breath, for if they have bad breath their work will crack when refired.</div></div></folio></body></html>

<m>Iron scale</m> taken from bars that have been in the fire for a <tmp>long time</tmp>, & <corr>which</corr> is thick, is much better than <m>the common delicate kind that falls under the anvil</m> in the <tl>forge</tl>, because it imitates <m>niello</m>. To said <m>black</m>, described elsewhere, some add <del><fr>d</fr></del> a little <m>minium</m> to it.</div></div><div id="p041v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Sheared <al>ewes</al></h2>
If the <pro>shearer</pro> wounds them at some point, he applies the very excrement of the ewe on it. When they are fat, they are easier to shear and do not get hurt as easily.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">If the <pro>shearer</pro> wants to 'viscorter' them, that is to castrate them as <x>they</x> are one or two years old, he must not have been with his wife, because this would cause the <al>sheep</al> to die.</div></div><div id="p041v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Colors and <m>gilding</m> on <m>glass</m></h2>
One ought not to give as strong <m>gum water</m> on <m>glass</m> for the <del><m>gold</m> layer as for</del> <m>silver</m> layer as for the <m>gold</m> layer because a <m>silver</m> leaf is twice as strong as a <m>gold</m> leaf. Also, <m>silver</m> is harder and therefore does not scratch as easily. <del><fr>Q</fr></del> And if the <m>gum</m> was not a little strong for the <m>silver</m>, the latter would not crack so neatly. When you work, <del>the humid</del> the exhalation of your <bp>breath</bp> moistens the leaf layered on the <m>glass</m>, & therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times. You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank & serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not quite clean of the <m>gum</m>'s greasiness  & viscosity, <del>the</del> & of other things, the colors would not be so brisk on it. To advance your works, you can <fr>ponce</fr>, or, better still, layer the <m>gum</m> & leaf on a cut <m>paper</m>. In this way, you will need to repair very little. If you want to make <m>gold</m> color there without <m>gold</m>, mix soaked dried <m>saffron</m> with a little <m>massicot</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

The olives go bad if you do not refresh their <m>salt water</m> once a month, do not touch it with your hands, otherwise they will go bad.</div></div><div id="p093r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Country folk's observation</h2>
When it freezes on Palm Sunday, it will freeze every month of the year</div><div data-layout="center">When the first flowers fall because of the frost, the other flowers also start perish.</div> </div><div id="p093r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Grafts</h2>
Do not use a graft from <m>old wood</m>, because it never makes a beautiful tree.</div><div data-layout="center">Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.</div><div data-layout="center">Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.</div><div data-layout="center">All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.</div></div><div id="p093r_a4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Sand</h2>

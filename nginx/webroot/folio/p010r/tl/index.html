Take <m>horn</m> from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, & underneath make the figure of your <m>jasper</m>, <m>cornalines</m>, & other <m>stones</m>, which will be a work more appropriate than on <m>glass</m>, which is too shiny. And the <m>horn</m> presents a lustre & a fatty polish like <m>jasper</m>.</div><div data-layout="center">You know, as with scrapings of the said <m>horn</m>, the <m><pa>roses</pa></m> can be imitated. The <del>horn</del> colors for this <m>jasper</m> wants to have a base with <m>clear turpentine</m> or <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> varnish</m>. <add>And colors matte in body are not so appropriate here, however beautiful they are.</add> <add>One needs to <m>oil</m> the unpainted reverse with <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>.</add></div><div data-layout="top">Thin <m>glass</m>, for this effect, is very beautiful.</div><div data-layout="left-top">You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the <m>filings of talc or of pins</m> on the fresh <m>cement</m> of the said joints. One needs to join them with <m>gum ammoniac</m> mixed in <m>vinegar</m>. To better counterfeit <m>marbled jasper</m>, apply <m>wool of thick hairs</m> dyed in diverse colors & intermingled. After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them, then lay down <m>gold &silver leaf</m>. If you lay down on the <m>horn</m> colors of <m>turpentine</m>, give it a base of <m>silver</m> or of <m>tin leaf</m>. You can also <tl>file</tl> <m>horn</m> & mix it with <m>strong glue</m>, & lay it down onto the joints of the piece of <m>horn</m>, then even it with a <tl>plane</tl>.</div></div><div id="p010r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Stil de grain yellow</m></h2>
It is made in <pl>Lyon</pl> from the <m>juice of weld</m> & <m>chalk</m> mixed together or better yet with <m>ceruse</m>, which is appropriate for <m>distemper</m> and <m>oil</m>. </div></div><div id="p010r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><pa>Roses</pa></h2>
These are counterfeited either with the scrapings of <del><ill></del> <m>horn used for lanterns</m>, or with scrapings of <m>parchment</m>, very clear, delicate & dyed, employed as you know.</div></div> <div id="p010r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Purple color</h2>
<pro>Painters</pro> make it beautifully by making the first layer of <m>common azur</m>, or better yet <m><fr>azur d'esmail</fr></m>, & next they glaze it with <m>lake</m>, which will be more appropriate for this if you mix in <m>alum</m>, which gives it a violet tint depending on the quantity that you mix in.</div> </div> <div id="p010r_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Powder for hourglasses</h2>
It is made very subtle & not subject to rust &by its weight able to flow. Taking i <ms>lb</ms> of <m>lead</m>, melt it and skim and purify it from its filth, then pour into it four  of finely pulverized <m>common salt</m>, and take good care that it has no <m>stones</m> nor earth. And immediately after you have poured it, mix continuously very well with an <m>iron</m> <sup>tool</sup> until the <m>lead</m> and <m>salt</m> are well incorporated, and take it immediately from the fire, stirring continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl> and pass it through a fine <tl>sieve</tl>, then wash it as many as times as necessary until the <m>water</m> becomes clear, throwing out the fine powder that will float on it, renewing the <m>water</m> as many times as necessary until it is all even.</div></div></folio></body></html>

You must firstly mold it with <m>plaster</m> as has been said before, and in the <m>plaster</m> throw in some <m>wax</m> from which will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at your pleasure.  Then you will mold this <m>wax</m> relief once more in <m>plaster</m>, or even better with your tempered sand,  <div data-layout="left-bottom">Because you have molded one of your halves with <m>plaster</m> and <m>wax</m>, you can do the same thing to the other half.</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

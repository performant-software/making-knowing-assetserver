The Spanish ones are not as well sharpened from the forge since they sharpen them with their feet and this is what makes them wavy.</div> <div data-layout="center">Vienna blades cost commonly Xviii or 19 lb.</div> <div data-layout="center">The first thing the <pro>furbisher</pro> does to his new blades is to draw them out from the sheath, which he does himself or has it done by <pro>locksmiths</pro> or <pro>blacksmiths</pro> to whom he gives some liart for their <m>charcoal</m>. Afterwards they pass it over a grindstone to cut it down. Then they lay it down on the chameau<m>,</m> and with some powdered <m>emery</m>, fine and soft as flour, and soaked with <m>oil</m> to make it take, they polish the sword with the stick used to take off the tracks left by the grindstone and then they clean the blade well with the <m>emery</m>. And they add a drop or two of <m>oil</m> spread with the finger to give it luster. Once the <m>oil</m> is applied, they polish it again on the chameau with the &quot;felin&quot; which is a thunderstone mounted on the middle of a stick like the &quot;fustée.&quot; And this stick is called the &quot;felindel&quot; stick. Once they used the &quot;felin,&quot; they polish it again with some <m>chalk</m> and the <m>oil</m> <x>already</x> on the sword. After they follow this and going over it again, they polish it with dry <m>chalk</m>. Finally when they are finished with mounting <x>of the pommel and guard</x>, they give it a sharp edge with a file. They then dry it and sharpen it and furbish it again with some dry <m>chalk</m>. At the end when they are completed and mounted, they give it <x>the blade</x> a sharp edge with a grater.</div> <div data-layout="center">They are polished on a false mounting with the guards which are present in order to find out if they work well together. And employing a blade of the sort of which all the sizes should be made in the hand, one conjectures whether it will be as strong when mounted.</div> <div data-layout="center">One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of <m>wood</m>, then with a file, they enlarge <x>it</x> if needed for attaching the guard. Then to clench it, one positions the place to be riveted and the pommel on a piece of <m>wood</m>. And with a hammer, one beats on the top to make it very level and to secure the pommel. Then with the hammer, one finishes the rivet when the hammer is well secured and does not shake. The <m>wood</m> is placed so as not to put gashes in the pommel. Afterwards one makes a place for the rivet with a file or chisel. And some make the rivet <x>or attachment</x> in a diamond-shape but this is not as good as a round <x>topped one</x> because one cuts oneself on the corner of the rivet.</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

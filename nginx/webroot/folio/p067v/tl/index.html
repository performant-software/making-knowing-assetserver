If they are not <fr>trempées à pacquet</fr>, that is, in the manner described, with <m>soot</m>, <m>salt</m>, & <m>vinegar</m>, they will not be good. The large <tl>square files</tl> used by <pro>locksmiths</pro> to draft their work are only made of <m><fr>fer doulx</fr></m>, But the <tl>soft files</tl> should be made of <m>steel</m>. <pro>Founders</pro> whose work is to repair <m>latten</m> & <m>copper</m> should have their files coarse otherwise they fill up with <m>copper</m> which makes them smooth & soon renders them useless. <m>Latten</m>, which is more brittle, welcomes softer files than <m>copper</m> does.</div> </div><div id="p067v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><al>Oxen</al> foot bones for sand</m></h2>
Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the flame of <m>straw</m>. But if you mold them in a <fr>noyau</fr>, give it its first layer, simple  & very thin, with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>, & leave to dry at ease. Next fortify the following layers with <m>wadding</m> mixed with the said tempered <m>bone sand</m>.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">It is the neatest sand that can be found for <m>copper</m>.</div></div><div id="p067v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><fr>Huiles d'essence</fr></m></h2> 
<m><add><pa>Walnut</pa></add> oil</m> mixed with as much of <m>turpentine</m> & distilled by an <tl>alembic</tl> renders an essence whiter than <m>common water</m>. But this has no body & does not give a bond for colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves the color without stickiness and faded. These, imbibed in this way, would not let you work or soften, no more than in <m>distemper</m>. But you rectify this fault, by giving it a little body with <m>turpentine</m>, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can work with <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m> & will make a perfect <m>lead white</m>. <m>Turpentine varnish</m> made with this <m>oil</m> is dry in one <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

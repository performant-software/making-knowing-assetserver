It softens like <m>paste</m> when boiled in melted <m>wax</m>, and takes color boiled with <m>fat of a young <al>goat</al></m>, for that of a <al>goat</al> would make it break, principally if it is glazed.</div></div><div id="p071r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><fr>Bois madre</fr></m></h2>
The <m><pa>elm</pa></m>, in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks diversified with grey and black, and the <m>root of the <pa>maple</pa></m>, but one needs to chose well the grain of the <m>wood</m>.

When the <pl>English</pl> have a cold, they mull <m>wine</m> in this way. They heat <m>wine</m> in a <del>large</del> <m>tin</m> pot until it boils, and when it becomes frothy, <del>they light it with burning <m>paper</m> to determine if it is hot enough. After, to mull the whole of it, they pour it from one vessel into another, as if they wanted to churn <m>eau pan√©e</m>, and as they do it, someone else lights with a burning <m>paper</m> what is falling from the one vessel into the other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the <m>wine</m> is mulled enough, heat it again a little while adding a few <m>cloves</m> & a sufficient quantity of <m>sugar</m>. And they <sup>the <pl>English</pl></sup> <del> drink it when it is as hot as possible in order to overcome their melancholy.</div><div data-layout="left-middle"><pl>English</pl> commoners put <m>sugar</m> in <m>wine</m> as a substitute for new sweet <m>wine</m>, which they cannot have because, owing to the long sea crossing, the <m>wine</m> loses its sweetness and clarifies itself before it reaches their country.</div></div> <div id="p071r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Weary <al>horses</al></h2>
In order to restore a harried <al>horse</al>, they make it drink some of the aforesaid <m>wine</m> through a horn, and it finds itself disposed to do an even harder labor.</div></div><div id="p071r_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Eau de vie</m></h2>
The <al>Irish</al> do not drink any <m>wine</m> because they convert it into <m>spirits</m>, which they use almost as habitually as we use <m>wine</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

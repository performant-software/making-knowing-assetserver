It is said that in <pl>Lorraine</pl> and <pl>Flanders</pl> <m>linking glass</m> is made of <m>fern ashes</m> and <m>pebbles</m>. First they blow up a long still that another worker breaks off and cuts vertically with big shears. Then this long still expands by being placed on a stone or large platine in a furnace slightly colder than one for melting. Furthermore, they flatten it by rolling <sup>over</sup> it a big and long iron stick. Then they take it out of the annealing  furnace. Similarly, they make some in <pl>England</pl> that are quite beautiful. Close to <pl>Rouen</pl> in <pl>France</pl>, flat glass is made with some <m>saltworth</m> and <m>pebbles</m> and is whiter and softer than the <pl>Lorraine</pl> one, because it can be melted with a candle, unlike the <pl>Lorraine</pl> one. This flat <m>glass</m> is blown up in a long still -- the end of which someone else cuts and blows up whilst turning it, then flattens it using a plane which is on the ground, and then reheats it. Thus the middle of the still, where it began, always stays the same.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">The <m>glass</m>, when wet, can be broken again with the flame of a candle, but not as precisely as with hot iron.</div></div></folio></body></html>

You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way lean & arid, such that it does not bind at all, like <m>the one from the <env>sea</env></m> or <del><fr>desei</fr></del> <m>from <env>sandy paths</env> dried out by the <env>sun</env></m>. But <add>choose</add> them <del>or in <fr>t</fr></del> preferably from <env>quar<del><fr>reries</fr></del>ries</env> or <env>rock caves</env>, because that one is best, as long as it is very fine. You will know the vein if, in the greyish <env>rocks</env> or <env>quarries</env> <del><fr>qu</fr></del> that seem to be made of <m><fr>arene</fr></m>, you see <tmp><env>after rainy weather</env></tmp>, certain little amounts like dust attached to the said <env>rocks</env>, or if a little piece flakes off, easily crushed between your <tl><bp>hands</bp></tl>, due to humidity. You will also find it in <m>lean soils</m>, which comes off in <del><fr>lop</fr></del> large lumps like <m>stones of <fr>tuf</fr></m> <del><fr>et ne</fr></del>, or among <m><fr>terres <pl>boulv√®nes</pl></fr></m>, which are much better than those from <m>fat & strong earths</m>. And one ought not to take it from the surface, for fear that it be mixed with <m>common earth</m>, but three or 4 <ms><bp>feet</bp></ms> below & the closest to the <m><fr>tuf</fr></m> or <m>stone</m>. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say it starts to form itself in stone. But when it is wet, it comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is well granular, & that when crushing it between the <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl>, it renders itself really very fine,  <del>like impalpable</del>, keeping nevertheless its asperity of <m><fr>arene</fr></m>, without <m>muddying</m> the <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> like <m>clay</m>. It dries up slightly on the fire, then it disintegrates & passes finely through a <tl>double sieve</tl> or a <tl><m>linen</m> sleeve</tl>, then takes moistures with <m>wine</m> or <m>magistra</m> & @ / <la>Verte</la></div><div data-layout="left-middle">The <pl>Toulouse</pl> <pro>molder</pro> reheats it strongly then grinds it finely on <tl><m>marble</m></tl> and passes it through a <tl><m>linen</m></tl> & moistens <del><fr>pass</fr></del> it with <m>wine</m>.

Pound <m><pa>puffball</pa></m> in <m>cistern water</m>, and no other, and wash with this whitened <m>water</m>. This is highly regarded. And I believe that making it from <m><pa>wheat</pa> starch</m> and using that would be even better.</div></div><div id="p020v_2"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Against windiness, colic, etc.</h2>
<m>Sap squeezed<sup> from <pa>orange</pa> peel</sup></m> or <m>water distilled from <pa>orange</pa> peel</m> is excellent against windy colics. <m>Candied peel</m> is also excellent for <bp>stomach</bp> winds. And to try it, having poured <m>sparkling wine</m> in a <tl>glass</tl>, press <m><pa>orange</pa> juice</m> on the <m>wine's foam</m>, which comes only from vapor and wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also, if you squeeze <m>juice</m> against a candle it will burn brighter.</div></div><div id="p020v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><fr><pa>Eschervis</pa> racine</fr></m></h2>
They want to be planted in a very humid place or such that, with <sup>water from</sup> wells or fountains, they can be frequently watered, because this makes them tender.

Pound an <m><pa>onion</pa></m> with <m>verjuice</m> and leave it to soak like this, then apply it.Or better, apply <m>black soap</m> on the burn. Experimented.</div></div><div id="p020v_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>A common saying</h2>
Steeple of <pl>Rodez</pl>, church of <pl>Albi</pl>, bells of <pl>Mende</pl>. However, the bell of <pl>Toulouse</pl> named Cardaillac is held to be one of the most beautiful in <pl>France</pl>, all the more since it weighs two hundred and fifty <fr><ms>quintal</ms></fr>s.</div></div><div id="p020v_6"><div data-layout="center"><h2>A form of regimen</h2>
Every <tmp>morning</tmp>, take two or three <m>eggs</m> laid on the same day or the <tmp>day</tmp> before. Heat them up but do not cook them. Eat the <m>yolk</m>s well dusted with <m>sugar</m>.

<m>Enamel</m> takes more readily on <m>copper</m> than on <m>silver</m>.

If you want to trace some history in intaglio on <m>glass</m>, you can do it in different ways. Lay your <m>glass pane</m> <del>on</del>, the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, & having cleaned the <m>glass</m> well with <m>lye</m> & <m>ash</m> so that it is not greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with <m><fr>noir à huile</fr></m> or <m><fr>noir d’escaille</fr></m> with the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>, if you want to paint with colors in the manner of <pro>glaziers</pro>, who wash their <m>glass pane</m> with <m><fr>noir d’escaille</fr></m> & then scrape & clear the parts which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for shading. But if you want to make <m>gilt</m> histories on <m>glass</m> with a background of colors, which imitates the <fr>basse-taille</fr> of <pro>goldsmiths</pro>, <m>gild</m> your entire <m>glass pane</m> with <m>gum water</m> or <m><pa>garlic</pa> juice</m> or <m><pa>fig-tree</pa> milk</m>. Then moisten your printed history between two wet <tl><m><pl>linen</pl> cloths</m></tl> & lay it down on the <m>gilt glass</m>. Then with a <tl>pin</tl> mounted on the end of a small <tl>stick</tl>, follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to pounce it, & thus you shall exactly trace it on the <m>gilding of the glass</m>. & next you shall clear the background & that which needs to be blank with a quite pointy <tl><m>steel</m> awl</tl>, & and neatly follow once more the lines & accomplish your work & fashion your faces & flesh tones in pounded <m>silver</m>; then you shall fill the background with <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m> or <m>verdigris</m> or <m>fine <fr>laque platte</fr></m> <del><fr>platte</fr></del> tempered with <m>clear turpentine</m>, mixed with a little of <m>tear of mastic</m> if you want that the colors hold together more & not to spread. Next, layer on the back of the <m>glass</m> & over the colors a <m>white tin</m> sheet. And once this is dry, you can cover the <m>tin</m> sheet <del>of</del> with color to hide your secret. The <m>tin</m> sheet gives light to the colors. Thus you will be able to paint without being</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

Things twice reheated are dissolve easily into <m>water</m>. If you don't do that your work will be hard to be stripped of the mold without being spoiled.</div><div data-layout="center">Good <m>stone alum</m> is white and as shiny as white silk, this <m>stone alum</m> is made of long pieces, as long as a finger, & is very fragile & woolly and fluffy. <m>Stone alum</m> made of <m>stone</m> is harder & not so good. The best quality can be found in France near Ronan. For our <m>sand</m>, <m>stone alum</m> must be crushed into a mortar, and must be ground on the <m>marble</m> again. Don't even think about sieving it because this matter is fat & woolly, it wouldn't pass through any sieve because of the very fine & soft filaments. These filaments give the <m>sand</m> a much greater binding effect than natural <m>wool</m> or even the <m>filler</m> the <pro>foundry owner</pro> uses for big works, because natural <m>wool</m> & <m>filler</m> burn and <m>stone feather alum</m> resists fire.</div> <div data-layout="center">When you cast surround the <m>sand</m> of your mold with very beaten greasy <m>earth</m>.

Because <m>stone alum</m> soften molds. Once reheated do not grind the <m>stone alum</m> again, leave it ground as the <pro>apothecaries</pro> did. It will not prevent the cast from being neat, & will give more binder to your cast. When the mold holds the color of the brick and is reddened then it will be harder.</div></div></folio></body></html>

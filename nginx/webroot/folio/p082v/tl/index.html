If it is too fat, one ought to reheat it and sieve it again.</div></div><div id="p082v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Ways of casting in <m>bronze</m></h2>
<m>Latten of <fr>potin</fr></m> <del><fr>cor</fr></del>, which is the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many people, than <m>fine latten of skillets</m>, just like all <m>fine latten</m> molds neater than <m>red copper</m>. If you want to cast something fine & thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it smokes a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat well, place your <tl>crucible</tl> as low as possible & at the very bottom of the <tl>forge</tl>, so that the <tl>bellows</tl> <del><fr>fra</fr></del> beat on the middle of the <tl>crucible</tl>, for in this way it is better than on the <tl>grill</tl> on which one usually puts the <tl>crucible</tl>, under which the <tl>bellows</tl> beat. It is true that the <tl>crucible</tl> risks more danger breaking, but you can <m>lute</m> it as you know <pro>founders</pro> do. And also, one ought to maintain the <m>charcoal</m> between the <tl>bellows</tl> & the <tl>crucible</tl>. Also take heed to cast all at once & not in increments & drop by drop, which would stop & plug up the conduit of the substance. And if make in the cast an <fr>abreveoir</fr> to <fr>abreuver</fr> the medal, it would be even better.  And so that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with a <tl><m>wood</m> stick</tl>, for <m>iron</m> only makes it brittle.

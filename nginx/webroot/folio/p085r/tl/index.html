This worked very well and I molded a medal of high relief very neatly, without making any stickiness, which a lot of good sands, such as <m>felt</m>, <m>burnt bone</m> & <m>iron dross</m>, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it & my <tl>mold</tl> became hard like <m>marble</m>, and I realized with this, that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some <m>water</m>, which gives them body & compactness, like <m>egg glair</m>, <m>gummed water</m>, <del><fr>ea</fr></del> <m>wine boiled with <pa>elm root</pa></m>, & and lightly <m>oil</m> the medal, it withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as <m>glass</m>.

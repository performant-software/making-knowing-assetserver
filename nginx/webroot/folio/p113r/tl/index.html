And be advised that these needle points must be of the thinnest kind of <m>iron</m> wire, with a length that is suitable to the animal; because the smaller your needle is, the smaller the leftover hole will be. However, you must have different sized ones because there are some needles that go on the body & in places that are thicker, like under the throat, and some <sup>needles</sup> must be longer & stronger than the ones used on legs & thin places, where the needles must be subtle & thin, almost like the biggest harpsichord strings. And it would be better if they were of <m>iron</m> wire, which is firmer than the one made of <m>latten</m>. And if piece of a tail, a piece of nail or a piece of leg to the body needs to be joined to the body, do not use the needle; it would damage these parts. But apply a bit of <m>wax</m>, as big as a <m>grain of millet</m>, between the body & the end of the tail. Then with a bit of <m>iron</m> wire, flattened & warm, touch the <m>wax</m> & join the two pieces by applying a bit of pressure.

Have a porringer of <m>leaded earth</m> of such a size that it can hold the wet sand which will be needed to fill your mold in one go, which is better than in two gos, because if you do not throw the second load of sand in very quickly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the first one will take & become solid,</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

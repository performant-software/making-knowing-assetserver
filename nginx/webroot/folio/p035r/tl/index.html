Take a string or a small stick and measure from the tip of his ear to the tip of his nose and show it to him. Thus you will teach him something you did not know, and neither did he.</div></div><div id="p035r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>To support a bucket of <m>water</m> on the points of three knives laid flat without touching the ground</h2>
According to the strength of your knives, either kitchen or table knives, you will make them support a large weight on their tips laid flat arranged in a triangle, edge to edge, as you can see, and not touching the ground. And after arranging them this way, if you turn them the other way without disassembling them, the handles can also support a large weight without touching the ground. You can as well adapt this to other uses with pikes, with timbers, or to quickly make a tripod in a camp with three halberd points. If the edge of the knife marked A is turned to the left, the butts of the handles will rise, but if the edge of the same knife is turned to the right, the tips will rise.</div></div><div id="p035r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>To boil an <m>egg</m> in cold <m>water</m> without a fire</h2>
Empty an <m>egg</m> from both ends so that nothing remains inside, then fill it with <m>quicklime</m> and <m>natural sulphur</m>, then plug the holes with <m>wax</m> and put it in <m>water</m> so that it floats two or three fingers <x>above the surface</x>.</div></div><div id="p035r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>To make <al>rabbits</al> come out of a burrow</h2>
Have some <m>embers</m> in a pot, and after putting <m>sulphur</m> on top, place it inside the burrows and block them with something light.</div></div></folio></body></html>

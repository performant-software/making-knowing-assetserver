You can damask a <m> cloth</m> of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is <m>dye</m>d yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some <m>string</m> or a bigger <m>cord</m> loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a <m>dye</m> of <m>woad</m> or <m>pastel</m> and it will become green, except that which is beneath the <m>string</m>, which will remain yellow because the <m>green dye</m> will not have penetrated there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of <m>string</m> or <m>cord</m>, add some pieces of poor quality <m>cloth</m> cut in Moorish shapes on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.</div></div><div id="p015r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Casting molten <m>metals</m></h2>
One casts candlesticks and small works in a <tl>frame</tl> with sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles the frame with <m>flour</m> in order to make the  <del><fr>e metal</fr></del> <m>copper</m> or <m>latten</m> run better. When the sand has been used for a <ms>month</ms>, it is necessary to take some new sand, because the one that was used, having been reheated <del>in fire</del>  by the heat of molten <m>metal</m></div></div><div id="p015r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Casting <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m></h2>
The sand must be from something very dry & arid & reheated well in the <tl>frame</tl>, because, if it were humid, like <m><pro>founder</pro>'s sand</m>, the <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> would spatter, & cause damage. It is also necessary for the <m>earth</m> to absorb the <m>metal</m>, for cast <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m> <del>is</del> become very spongy. That is why it must be beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon handles.</div></div></folio></body></html>

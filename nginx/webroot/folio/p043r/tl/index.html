One needs to give four layers of <pro>painters</pro>' <m>glue</m> in distemper on the <m>plaster</m> portrait, always leaving each layer to dry. Next, with <m>mine d’<pl>Angleterre</pl></m> ground on a marble, or burnt <m>lead</m>, grind <del>av</del> & distemper with a bit of <m>gum</m> or <del><fr>go</fr></del> <m>glue</m>, lay down lightly. Once dry, rub lightly with a little <m>cotton</m> and the <m>plaster</m> portrait will seem to be of <m>lead</m>. Others grind <m>minium</m> with <m>quicksilver</m>.</div></div><div id="p043r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Purpurine</m></h2>
The soft <m>tin</m>, <ms>half an ounce</ms> of, melt it in a <tl>spoon</tl>. Once melted, throw in an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>☿</m>, mix together. Once cold, grind on <m>porphyry</m>. Next take an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>sulfur</m>, the yellowest that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a <del><it>a pignatta</it></del> <tl><m>glass</m> sublimatorium</tl>, hold this over a small fire for an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> & for an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> over a stronger one & for an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> over a very strong fire, and it will be done. Next, to use it, apply <m>soot black</m> with the <m>glue</m> that <pro>painters</pro> use to paint, <del>&</del> two or three times, until it is quite black. Next apply a little <m>varnish</m>. Once dry, apply the <m>purpurine</m> a secco with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> where you want. The more you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if you want, apply <m>varnish</m> on top.</div></div><div id="p043r_a4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>White bronzing</h2>
Apply black with <m>glue</m>, as was said, on the medal, then <m>varnish</m>. Once dry, grate <m><fr>mine d'<pl>Angleterre</pl></fr></m> on top with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> or a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>.

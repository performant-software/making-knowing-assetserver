Two kinds are made in <pl>Toulouse</pl>, one to cover rooms' walls which are finely woven, almost like <m>straw</m> hats worn by villagers, and are made in long rolls, some 10 <m>straws</m> wide, others 13. And they work on them mainly in summer and winter. Then when they prepare it they sew it, but beforehand they dye it in usually three colours: green, red and sometimes purple. The green one is made with only a <m>pastel tincture</m> since green is made from yellow and blue, so the <m>pastel</m> dyes the dark yellow <m>straw</m>. It becomes bright green. For red they use some <m>alum</m> and <m>brazil wood</m>, for purple they use <m>pastel</m> and some <m>coperous</m> which darkens blue with its black tincture.</div></div> <div id="p032v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><pro>Glassmakers</pro></h2>
They have no way to produce a perfect red that needs to be annealed. Try, however, the <m><pl>German</pl> red</m> which is scaled red. They produce their ordinary red with some <m>sanguine</m>, <m>iced pewter</m>, <m>lead rocks</m>, and some <m>iron file dust</m>. This red is to be applied on both sides of the <m>glass</m> because it is more colourful. If it were applied on one side only it would look pastel orange.</div></div><div id="p032v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><pro>Founder</pro></h2>
They pay xx <cn>lb</cn> for a <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>rosette</m>, which is harder to melt than <m>latten</m> because it is softer. For, the softer the <m><add>great</add> metals</m> <add><m>Gold</m>, <m>silver</m> <m>copper</m><br/><m>latten</m> <m>iron</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

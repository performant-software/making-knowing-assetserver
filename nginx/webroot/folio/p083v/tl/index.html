Dissolve in <env>damp place</env> some <m>tallow of glass</m>, and then place this <m>water</m> on what you want to mold, having encircled it, and place it to coagulate on the hot <m>ashes</m>. Do the same with <m>vitriol</m> & <m>copperas</m>, which, once well calcined, reduce in <m>water</m>.</div></div><div id="p083v_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.</h2>
It is necessary to cast two pieces of <m>copper</m>, <m>latten</m> or similar <m>metal</m>, very neatly, and then when you have molded the cavity in the sand, leave the figure of <m>metal</m> that <corr>you</corr> have molded in the <tl>frame</tl>, without moving it from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a little & push the figure down in the <tl>frame</tl>.</div><div data-layout="center">It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the <m>filth</m> & <m>grime</m> accumulate. And, in this way, if you were mold the face towards the cast, some <m>grime</m> could be found there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier to repair.</div> <div data-layout="center"><m>Vinegar</m> is better for moistening than <m>wine</m>. It is necessary that the <tl>frame</tl> be well smooth and even, otherwise <del>and that the cast be</del>, as you press on one side, the other one lifts.</div><div data-layout="center">This is why the <tl>press</tl> is better, for it tightens evenly, & more than your <tl><bp>hands</bp></tl>, and makesthe <m>lumpy sand</m>, which is damp, communicate its humidity to the <m>soft & fine sand</m>, which is sprinkled & <fr>ponc√©</fr> dry on the medal.</div><div data-layout="center">When you mold, always leave your medal in <del>one of</del> <add>the</add> <tl>frames</tl>, <del>is</del> <add>without stirring it</add> because, if your cavity is not molded very neatly, you can put it back in the right place by means of <tl>pegs</tl>, which will prevent it from shifting. But, at first, <fr>ponce</fr> yout medal with very fine <m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, & <del><fr>se</fr></del> next clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release.</div><div data-layout="center">Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the <tl>frame</tl> & the sand.</div> </div><div id="p083v_a3"><div data-layout="center"><margin>left-middle</margin><h2><tl>Bellows</tl></h2>
To melt with <tl>bellows</tl>, & hasten your <fr>fonte</fr>, & also cast hotter <del><fr>po</fr></del>, do not place your <tl>bellows</tl> at the bottom near the foot of the <tl>furnace</tl>, for fear that some <m>charcoal </m>might <del>you</del> enters it, put them almost under the <tl><fr>grille</fr></tl>. It is good that your <tl>bellow furnace</tl> be in an <env>aerated place</env> so that the <env>wind</env> might make it heat better, & that it be well dry & and reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the <tl>furnace</tl> & that there is only entry of the <fr>tuelle</fr> of the <tl>bellows</tl>. And by the end, one ought to give it a good stoking, since at the beginning you will blow gently.</div></div></folio></body></html>

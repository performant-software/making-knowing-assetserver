Take <m>tragacanth gum</m> and put it to soak until, having drunk its <m>water</m>, it is swollen & rendered like <m>jelly</m>. Then crush it quite hard on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl> & next take <m><pa>rye</pa> flour</m>, which is better than <m><pa>wheat</pa></m> because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and sprinkle your <m>tragacanth gum</m> with it, & continue to grind <add>and mix in</add> thus, little by little, <del><fr>le et mesler legi</fr></del> the very finely sieved <m>flour</m>. And knead it as if you wanted to make <m>bread</m>, until <del>you</del> you perceive that it has enough body & is as firm as <m>bread dough</m> that one is ready to put in the <tl>oven</tl>. This is perceivable when it can stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it would not <del><fr>sti</fr></del> release well. Thus once prepared, rub the cavity <del><fr>au u</fr></del> with <m>oil</m>, with a <tl>brush</tl>, so that the <m>oil</m> penetrates everywhere to make it release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does not release well, mix in more <m>flour</m> until it has enough body. With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which will be dry within one <ms>day</ms>. Next, you will apply them with <m>strong glue</m> or <m>paste glue</m>, as you like, and you will be able to paint and decorate them with <m>gold</m> & all colors. In <pl>Rome</pl> they make ceiling and wall ornaments with it. One can make bed ornaments with it. <rub>If you want that the work stays white</rub>, it is better to mold with <m>plaster</m> instead of <m>flour</m>. It is true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare it like this: temper it, when it is powdered <del>strong</del>, in a good amount of <m>water</m> so that it is <add>clear</add>, & grind it several times a day for fifteen <ms>days</ms>. Then pour <m>water</m> at an angle, and gather the <m>plaster</m> & grind it finely on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, & place it in some kind of clean <tl><m>lead</m> vessel</tl>, so that no dust & dirt falls into it, & leave it <env>in the open air</env> & <env><fr>au serain</fr></env> for fifteen <ms>days</ms> with its <m>water</m>, and it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making a groundlayer of burnished <m>gold</m>. And this, when powder, you can mix, instead of <m>flour</m>, with <m>tragacanth gum</m>, and your work will be very beautiful. Lacking <m>plaster</m>, you can mix in well ground <m>chalk</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, & try <m>bole</m> & similar things. This <m>stucco</m> with the <m>tragacanth gum</m> has the quality, being malleable before being dry, of fitting on either round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little expense.</div><div data-layout="left-top">The <m>flour</m> is not good in this, but <m>chalk</m> or <m>ceruse</m> is.</div></div></folio></body></html>

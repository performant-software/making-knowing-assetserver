They paint without any traces of <m>oil</m>, except for faces where they outline the nose & the mouth in very fine black work. Then they make strokes & highlight them in white, and then they apply a coat of <m>flesh-tinted color</m>.  As for the background, they do it in natural <m>azur</m> from <pl>Acre</pl> to make it more beautiful, or <m>lacquer</m> for a quickly-done red, or for a finer red, <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m>. But it is necessary to apply it little by little so that it is smooth & of one color, & in the same way for other colors. Then they apply underneath it, a leaf of <m>topaz</m>, <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m>.</div></div><div id="p102v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Infusion of <m>anthos</m> or <m>rosemary</m></h2>
It is better to cook the flower in August & more suited to <m>oil</m>-making. Take as much as you want. Then put it into a bottle very well corked, & leave them to wilt in the shade for a day. Then add the first substance of <m>wine</m> & leave to settle three or four days; & express it all in another vessel and into this very same substance of <m>wine</m>, add seven or eight infusions made out of new flowers. Then leave the latest infusion in the sun for a month. Then distill it through a still. Then mix two ounces of this <m>water</m> with two or three spoons of <m>white wine</m>; but this is for the elderly. Paul the Third used it.</div></div><div id="p102v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Cast</h2>
<m>Tin</m> comes out better being thin & fine, rather than thick, because being thick & in great heat, it retracts. Therefore, if you want to mold a thick piece in <m>tin</m>, mold it only one one side, & with a cavity or one side, if it is possible, in that way you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to <m>solder</m> two halves together. But if you have to mold it thick, make the in the form & mold a lot of <fr>abreuvouers</fr> around the figure, in this way.</div></div></folio></body></html>

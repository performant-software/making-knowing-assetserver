It is necessary that the <tl>box mold</tl> be well smooth & that it fits well also on the <tl>board</tl> where it sits, so that it holds firm & does not shift when one moulds. It is necessary that the sand be clean & well chosen and well reheated, & pulverised very finely on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, for the one that you want to put first on the medal, and when molding you press strongly. Guard against <m>oiling</m> your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly and reheat well, & let cool. Moisten your sand with <m>wine boiled with <pa>elm</pa> root</m>, and cast <m>latten</m> which comes out well, namely from the <m>substance of the <fr>trebuschets</fr></m> and similar thin things. Make your cast broad & even if it is barely thick, it will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the <tl>mold</tl>. Cast from the foot of the medal, so that the face, further away from the heat, comes out better & sweetened from the violent heat. And if your <tl>box mold</tl> does not have vents, make some <del><fr>qu</fr></del> in the sand, which come, from the corners of the piece, to render themselves into the cast. Cast very hot, something that you will know, when you cast a little leftover substance in the one which has already been melted, & if it melts quickly, this is a sign it is <del><fr>fo</fr></del> well hot. At that time, invigorate the heat of your <tl>furnace</tl> with <tl>bellows</tl> of the right size, keeping the mouth of the <tl>furnace</tl> well covered with some big <del><m>copper</m></del> <tl><m>tile</m></tl> or other similar thing, which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take your well red <tl><fr>mollettes</fr></tl> & the <tl>crooked <m>iron</m></tl> as well, to clean the <m>charcoals</m> which are in your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a <tl><m>latten</m> wirebrush</tl>. The <m>grindings from sharpening large scissors & large knives</m> is very good for <m>copper</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">One believes it to be a great secret to add in it <m><pa>persicaire</pa></m>, which renders them soft as <m>lead</m>.Try to extract <m>salts</m> from it.</div></div></folio></body></html>

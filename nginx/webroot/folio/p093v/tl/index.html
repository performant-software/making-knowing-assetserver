Because colors in <m>distemper</m> dry quickly & one would not have leisure to perfect the shadows & touches on the face, one wets the reverse of the face which is on <m>canvas</m> with a wet <tl>sponge</tl>. Then, with a small <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>, one makes the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color, which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent areas. And with another <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> one does the shadows <add>again</add> by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone because they are made of <m>bistre</m>, which stains the <m>canvas</m> like <m>rust</m>. The said <m>bistre</m> is good <del>with</del> for making shadows in <m>distemper</m> <del>mix</del>, for in <m>oil</m> it has no body & would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in the said <m>bistre</m>, for shadow, <m><fr>ocre de ru</fr></m> & a little  <m>sap green</m>. The best <m>bistre</m> is the greasy & shiny kind from the <env>fireplaces of large kitchens</env>. It is difficult to grind & screeches on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl>.</div></div><div id="p093v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Azure</m></h2>
<m><fr>Azur dâ€™esmail</fr></m> always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the <fr>laveures</fr> makes it die. One needs to coat it two times, & the first very thick, moving the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> by laying it first lengthwise then across. <figure> It is better used on <m>canvas</m>, where it is imbibed immediately, than on <m>wood</m>. <m>Varnish</m> returns it to its vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it, <pro>painters</pro> bring their <tl>palette</tl> to the <pro>grocers</pro>, & distemper & alloy it with a little white ground in <m>oil</m>, for in this way, the beautiful shows its <fr>turquine</fr> vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most delicate is the best for working. It is thinned <del>working</del> by washing it.</div> </div><div id="p093v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Violet and <m>lake</m></h2>
It is made of <m>azure</m> & <m>lake</m> which is also assayed on the <tl>palette</tl> with white. It is deemed beautiful that which which, on a <m>polished knife</m> or on <tl><m>glass</m></tl> gives a clear <del>red</del> color of red rose, tending a little towards violet. The kind which is <del>blac</del> dark red is not as pleasant.</div></div></folio></body></html>

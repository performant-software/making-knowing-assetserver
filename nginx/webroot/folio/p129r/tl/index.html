If you are still in a hurry, dilute your color with <m>egg white</m> beaten with <m>fig peels</m>; and your work will soon be dry. But do apply it thinly.</div></div><div id="p129r_2"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Wormwood</h2>
 The pallid white of this herb is made from <m>green verditer</m>, <m>white lead</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, a bit of <m>massicot</m>, <m>scudegrun</m>, and <m>cendr√© d'azur</m>. Mix and arrange your color with a branch you have. </div></div><div id="p129r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><al>Viper color</al></h2>
 It is the most beautiful <al>snake</al> to mold, because it has very beautiful scales, round and transparent. Its natural color is made from good <m>verdigris</m> well ground, with good <m>vinegar</m>, if it is made of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. And in the darkest parts, season this first color with a little <m>sulfur</m>, as you know. And if you need to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub these parts with a rough cloth. Because of its nature, the male ejects a kind of small lump from its backside when pressed, like a half arquebus ball, made in its genitals, and full of highly poisonous prickles.</div> <div data-layout="center"> <div data-layout="left-middle"> Add a bit of <m>looking-glass tin</m> in your <m>tin</m>; your <al>lizard</al> will look as if made of <m>silver</m>.</div></div><div id="p129r_4"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Molded roses</h2>
 Roses are molded with difficulty because of their petals, which are very delicate, weak, and doubled. To avoid this, rub them with <m>wheat oil</m> which is very dessicative, and once dried it stiffens and firms up the leaves to separate them and for them to withstand soaked sand. Do the same thing with <al>flies</al>, pansies, and other delicate things like capers.</div></div></folio></body></html>

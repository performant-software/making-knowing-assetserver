Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But after you have made your design carefully, keep the space for shadows alone by themselves & for the lights & highlights individually as well, without layering a color all across & then highlighting or shading on it. And in this way, you further your work, economise your colours & work neatly, which is the reason that, the colors not being muddled nor mixed together, they do not die & you soften the colors better, since they are not so thick.</div></div><div id="p064r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Fatty oil</m></h2>
It is not good for working with colors because it makes them thick, & as difficult to work as <m>azur dâ€™esmail</m>. Use, then, the <m>clearest <pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> that you can, & the freshest.</div></div><div id="p064r_3"><div data-layout="center"> <h2><m>Vermilion</m></h2>
One ought not to keep it in <m>water</m> when <del>soaked</del> <add>ground</add> with <m>oil</m> for it loses its color. It is better to choose whitish <m>vermilion</m> than dark & blackish. For <m>vermilion</m> is usually mixed with a little <m>lake</m>, without which it would hardly be different from <m>minium</m>. But the pale kind one casts more vivacity than the dark one. It is not desiccative, & for this reason one mixes in <m>calcined <fr>cristallin</fr></m>.</div></div><div id="p064r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Oil</m> colors in <m>water</m></h2>
Usually, after grinding them one puts <corr>a</corr> <del><fr>fo</fr></del> piece of <m>tin leaf</m> on top, & one puts them in <m>water</m> to prevent them from drying out. But this is more appropriate for <m>ceruse</m>, <m>lead white</m>, <m>minium</m> & <m>massicot</m> than for the others, for <m>lake</m> dies there & loses its color, as does <m>azure vermilion</m>.</div></div><div id="p064_5"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Double layer</h2>
<m>Ver<add>digris</add></m> does not die, & thus does not need to be layered twice. But <m>lake</m> & others, & especially flesh color, <del>the</del> require two layers. Colors hardly change when they are dry.</div></div> <div id="p064r_6"><div data-layout="center"><margin>left-top</margin><h2><m>Yellow ochre</m></h2>
One needs a little of it in every flesh color.</div></div><div id="p064r_7"><div data-layout="center"><margin>left-middle</margin><h2>Softening</h2>
One softens in the same way on <m>oiled paper</m> as on <m>wood</m>. But it is easier to soften on <m>canvas</m>, because the softening must be rougher on it.</div></div><div id="p064_8"><div data-layout="center"><margin>left-bottom</margin><h2>Eye</h2>
 Every eye must follow the circle of the <tl>compass</tl> & not be flat & square.</div></div></folio></body></html>

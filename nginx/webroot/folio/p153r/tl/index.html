Firstly fashion your figure in <m>wax</m> on an even slab of <m>glass</m> or <m>slate</m>. After, mold it with our aforesaid sand, having beforehand lightly oiled it with <m>oil</m> as you know, and having rubbed it with <m>spirits</m>, while tempering your sand with <m>hot water</m>.  Having made the hollow part, cast it in <m>lead</m>, using the same alloy as you do for other figures that come out very neatly. However, if it does not release cleanly, repair it.  And then mold you <m>lead</m> relief with some <m>wax</m>. After, in your <m>wax</m> hollow part, throw in your tempered sand which will give you a relief, upon which you will cast your hollow part with <m>silver</m>, or any other metal used for seals.  But note that you must not make your hollow part with melted <m>wax</m>, but only with <m>wax</m> warmed in hot <m>water</m>, or even better in hot <m>urine</m>. Or else, if you have a relief in <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m>, or any other very neat and flawless metal, mold your <m>wax</m> hollow part directly upon it, and throw your sand in it <sup>wax hollow</sup>, which will form your relief, upon which you will cast your hollow part to make your seal or any other work.  You could also cast a hollow part directly from the main part of your metal, even <sup>should you want to cast</sup> in <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, which will not make the main part of your metal melt, if it has been lightly brushed with <m>crushed chalk</m>, or covered with <m>candle soot</m>, or with dried <m>egg white</m>.</div> <div data-layout="left-top">When you have the <m>wax</m> imprint of your seal, mold in a noyau this piece of <m>wax</m>, which is hollow like your seal, and your noyau will make a mold similar to the imprint and the seal.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">Your <m>wax</m> must be mixed with a color that has little body, so that you may better see your imprint.  The <m>lamp black</m> or <m>soot black</m> is good for this.  <m>White wax</m> to do this is even better.</div></div><div id="p153r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Giving a medal the thickness that you wish</h2>
Having cast your first mold, mix some <m>crocum</m> or well-ground <m>iron scales</m> to make it <sup>your mould</sup> firmer. And having taken hold, and made your hollow part very neat, take some paste made of fine</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

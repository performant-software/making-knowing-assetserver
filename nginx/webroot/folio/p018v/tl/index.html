Its cannonball weighs eight or 9 pounds  and its load is six pounds of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front is two. It is more appropriate against cities' defence rather than in battery. It is however sometimes used either to break a barricade or to support the battery after cannons have shot, in order to prevent the assailled from rebuilding after the cannons have played and shot. Four <al>horses</al> can carry it. It has a range of eight or nine hundreds <ms>paces</ms> and almost as many as the bastarde.</div><div data-layout="left-top">  To cannons and big pieces we give as much <m>powder</m> as a cannonball and a half's diameter in proportion to the <fr>escusson</fr>. For medium pieces, such as campaign pieces, and the ones smaller, we provide them with powder the equivalent of two cannonballs have a quantity of <m>powder</m> equivalent to two cannonballs thick in proportion to the <fr>passevolant</fr> and smaller ones are given three cannonballs thick of <m>powder</m>. Usually, all pieces are loaded up to the escusson.

Its cannonball weights 6 or 7 pounds and its loaded is 4 pounds of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front is two, like all the pieces under the mid-sized. The breech is thicker for they are in proportion longer and also because they are more frequently used than big pieces against houses or elsewhere. Their caliber is also small, so we give their breech a thickness of three cannonballs. They are used to follow immediately a camp and for the defence of cities and houses, settling them on walls or in a tower. Three good <al>horses</al> are required to carry it.</div><div data-layout="center">The passevolant weighs 6 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and is eight or nine <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weighs two pounds, and its load is a pound and a half of <m>powder</m>. The breech  is three cannonballs thick and the front two. Two <al>horses</al> can carry it because one single horse can't carry a piece. It is used for houses' defence or to be brought amongst the infantry to break a horsemen rank.</div><div data-layout="center">A <fr>faulconneau</fr> weighs 4 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and is 10 <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long.

The <pl>Flemish</pl> & those who paint panels by the dozen only make one layer & finish at the first go. But the colors soon die. And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer them lightly & not very thick, to soften them well.</div></div><div id="p066r_2"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Shadows</h2>
For women, <m>asphaltum</m>, <m>umber</m> & a little <m>lake</m>.</div></div> <div id="p066r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Painting in <m>distemper</m> on <m>wood</m></h2>
Because it is very tedious to paint in <m>distemper</m> on <m>wood</m>, and because one is at great pains to make a good <del>a</del> face on it, some thin their colors with <m>egg glair</m> passed through a <tl>sponge</tl>, or mixed with the <m>yolk</m>, <m>water</m>, & thoroughly beaten with the <m>skin of the <pa>fig tree</pa></m>. With this | they paint & soften on the <m>wood</m>, as with <m>oil</m>, and this supports the <m>varnish</m>, but this does not last.</div></div><div id="p066r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Colors in <m>oil</m> that are imbibed</h2>
It is best that colors in <m>oil</m> are imbibed, that is to say they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the <m>oil</m> has remained in that part which would make the colors die. The <m>varnish</m> mends all this & unites & renders it similar in one place as in another.</div><div data-layout="center">One needs gold color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it would be imbibed & would run.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">On <m>canvas</m> & in <m>distemper</m>, one gilds with <m>bole</m> & <m>honey</m> & a little <m>garlic juice</m>.</div></div><div id="p066r_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Gilding molding for panels with <m><fr>or mat</fr></m></h2>

After having gilded, let it dry & rest one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms>, next rub the gilding with a <tl>feather</tl> & <tl><m><pa>cotton</pa></m></tl> in order that no burrs remain, then varnish with <m><pl>Flanders</pl> varnish</m>, which you make mixed with a little <m><fr>eau de vye</fr></m>, to render it desiccative.</div> <div data-layout="center">The <m>varnish</m> will be dry in an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms>. It will increase the color of gold. And this <m><fr>or mat</fr></m> holds <env>in the rain</env>, even if one rubs it.

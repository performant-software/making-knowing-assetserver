They are called <m>steel</m> <sup>mirrors</sup> because in the past they were usually made of <m>steel</m> polished with <m>emery paste</m>. But more easily, various kinds are made of <m>cuivre franc</m>, which is <m>rosette</m> and <m>tin</m>, because these can be cast in a mold and made round, hollow, convex or in whatever various shapes you want to represent.</div><div data-layout="center">So take half <m>copper de rosette</m> and half soft <m>tin</m>, i.e. fine and yet unused. Place them in a crucible, and first melt the <m>copper</m>. Once it has been well melted, add the <m>tin</m> and mix them together and cast that in a <m>white stone</m> mold with no hole, and grease the mold, which should be moderately warm, with <m>oil</m>.

If you want to polish them on both sides, you only have to switch them, which means putting the one that was polishing in the <m>plaster</m> and <x>using</x> the one which was in the <m>plaster</m> to polish. Once they have been polished with <m>arene</m> you can soften them with <m>tripoli of Venice</m> that should not be <m>sand</m>y, and then with <m>paste</m>. You use <m>water</m> with <m>arene</m> to polish, but polishing with <m>tripoli</m> and <m>paste</m> is done dry. Once <sup>the mirror</sup> has been polished, you can set it.</div></div><div id="p005r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Concave mirrors</h2>
A concave mirror shaped in the aforesaid form produces an endless number of illusions which seem like magic. If one wants to see oneself from behind, you have to place the concave mirror on the ground on its foot, at a slant, and then look at it one step further. But if you look at it from a closer position, it shows you the right way up but with the face quite large and the hairs of your beard as thick as</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

First, one gives him an <m>egg</m> to do in which one has him make half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two & three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the <m>charcoal</m> by the end, & also the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>. Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to layer colors.</div></div><div id="p064v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>One also presents him with these strokes & lines</h2>
<del><fr>C</fr></del> <add>T</add>he figure of the <m>egg</m> is the main pattern for faces <add>and for bent bodies</add>, as the cross is the model for a straight & whole figure. Without these strokes you will never do well.</div></div><div id="p064v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Softening</h2>
To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but rather layer them twice, except for <m><fr>azur dâ€™esmail</fr></m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">All colors that have no body in <m>oil</m> have none in <m>distemper</m>, <del>and</del> but in <m>distemper</m> they sink to the bottom. <m>Distemper</m> colors want to be greasy, which is recognised when they gel on the <tl>palette</tl> once distempered in <m>oil</m>.</div></div><div id="p064v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Straight lines</h2>
You can use the <tl>ruler</tl>, but do not lay it flat on the panel, but as if lifted off, & resting on the edges of the panel. Otherwise you would smudge everything, & also you would not see the stroke well.</div></div><div id="p064v_5"><div data-layout="center">  <h2><m>Distemper</m></h2>
<m>Distemper</m> colors need to be <add>kept</add> darker <del><fr>pr</fr></del> while you temper them, <add>because they whiten while drying</add>. But <m>oil</m> colors remain the same in color.</div></div></folio></body></html>

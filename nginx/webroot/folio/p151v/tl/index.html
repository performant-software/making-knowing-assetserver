If you have some metal overflow at the joints of your mold, you will remove it, either with a burin, called a chaple, or with a very sharp pen-knife, or with a small file followed by the chisel.  Always keeping in front of you the real thing to do as best you can. You can curl on a file a chisel point, which is not at all moistened, to make something lumpy. For these <al>turtles</al> and any other hollow things which you can assume are quite big, create a <m>ligue</m> of half <m>lead</m> and half <m>refined tin</m>. There is more to do when molding a <al>turtle</al> than when molding a dozen flowers.  If there is <m>crocum</m> in your sand, there will be no metal overflow and if you are unfortunate enough that there should be some on the sides, these will be as thin as <m>paper</m>, as long as your mold is very tightly pressed together.  And to make the scales of <al>turtles</al> and other animals, you can make little chisel marks in the shape of round punch cutters, others in the shape of a gouge, or shaped like a <al>snake</al> or <al>lizard</al> scale, and other using a file used to make twisty bits and lumps. <al>Turtles</al> that do not need to be molded hollow are not as much work, because they are molded in two pieces and repair them with little chisels <sup>that make</sup> punch cutters, little couge, and serrated chisels.</div></div><div id="p151v_1"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Wheat oil</m></h2> 
You must make it between two empty <m>iron</m> blades, the bottom one in particular will be slanted downwards and on this one you will put an even and equal <sup>layer</sup> of <m>wheat</m>.  Then you will place on it the other <sup>blade</sup>, which is very hot, and you will press it down until you see the black <m>oil</m> drip. Remove the top blade when you have enough.  This <m>oil</m> dries very quickly.  It gilds <m>silver</m> and varnished things, deepens the color of gilded things, <sup>can be used</sup> as a <m>varnish</m> on <m>iron</m> before you engrave it, and to varnish the tanned <sup><m>leather</m> parts</sup> of sword hilts.  And it could also be used by <pro>those who make gilded <m>leather</m></pro>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">You must use this, as has been done recently.  And for things you need to mold, it must not be as thick as for dyeing.</div> <div data-layout="left-bottom">You cannot use this to oil hairy animals, because it is too strong and rigid, but it is good to apply to the foot of a little animal, like a <al>fly</al> and other similar things. It is also excellent to dye white stones <ill></div></div></folio></body></html>

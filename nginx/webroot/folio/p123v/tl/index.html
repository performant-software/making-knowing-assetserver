Then, little by little & with judgement intensify the fire. And <fr><del>y</del></fr> leave in the fullness of this your ingredients for 12 hours, or a natural day.  Make at each go a good quantity of this mixture to not have to repeat it too often, because the fumes, which are dangerous, could hurt you. And before working with it, take a good piece of buttered toast in the morning, and hold in your mouth the said <m>butter</m>, or <m>zedoary</m>, or <m>gold</m> coins, and <fr><del>ada</del></fr> cover your face with a towel from the eyes down. From this mass, the crust will serve to <del>make run</del> clarify <del>the great works of</del> the <m>silver</m> from the metallic mass <del>like <al>snakes</al> & similar things</del> when it starts to melt. <del>But</del> And then, the grain that will be at the bottom of the <tl>crucible</tl> should be reserved for <del>principally delicate flowers and herbs</del> putting a little in the melted <m>silver</m> when you want to cast it, <del>However it is necessary to always put a little of this grain in the <m>silver</m> when <del>you want to cast</del> it is melted and when you are ready to cast</del> as you do thus for fine <m>tin</m> on <m>copper</m>, & for <m>looking-glass tin</m> on <m>lead</m> and on <m>tin</m>. And just as <m>looking-glass tin</m> makes <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> too brittle if you put in too much, likewise the grain composed of the above-mentioned ingredients would make your silver too brittle if <del>l</del> you were to put in too much, and obscure it.  This above-mentioned composition will suffice you for a long time, when it has been on a <del>low</del> low fire for a whole day at the beginning & intensified degree by degree until the end. Having thrown one load of charcoal, let it consume itself, & let your <tl>crucible</tl> cool down. Then break it.  You will find two sheets & hard cakes in the <tl>crucible</tl>. The upper one looks stoned <del>Once</del>, once composed of <m>salts</m>,sublimated & mixed together. The lower one is metallic, composed of fillings, <m>aes ustum</m> & <m>antimony</m>, having very small grain. Pulverize the upper cake, made from <m>salts</m>, & put some in to lighten & clean the <m>silver</m> and the metallic grain can be used to put into the melted metal.</div><div data-layout="left-top"><m>Charcoal</m> fire</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">Or, after you have pestled your <m>drugs</m> by a rustic, and having put them in your crucible, & the latter luted & dry as said & place into the furnace, have the fire managed by a <fr>boutique</fr> boy, familiar with <m>charcoal</m>. </div> <div data-layout="left-middle">One sells this metallic mass to <pro>silversmiths</pro> to soften their solder, because when melting <m>brass</m> exhales.

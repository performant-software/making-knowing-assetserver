And to flatten it, take a small stick of <m>wood</m> that is round and of an even thickness, which has at both ends a small circle that sticks out from the rest, in order to give the necessary thickness to your <m>paste</m>.  And then with this rolling pin, flatten it so that it becomes thin and tenuous. Then apply it on the hollow part of your mold and press it down with <m>cotton</m>, and your figure will impress itself on the paste, in relief on one side, and hollow on the other.  This done, with a brush that is dipped in melted <m>butter</m>, grease the part of the <m>paste</m> that is hollow.  Then trim off the extra <m>paste</m> which extends beyond the hollow of the mold.  Also <m>oil</m> your mold with <m>olive oil</m>, as you have done with others. Apply your <m>clay</m> contour, and cast your second mold. And you will have a medal as thin and hollow on one side as you wish.  You can have various rolling pins which some edges are more raised than others, in order to make various thicknesses, or you can use sheets <m>lead</m> and <m>copper</m> of various thicknesses, or <m>cardboard</m>, all cut with the rolling pin.</div></div></div><div id="p153v_1"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Testing the virtues and strength of sand that is to be reheated</h2>
Once the sand has taken hold, you must find it soft and easy to cut, and not surly.  It is better to test it in a large and fantastical mold, rather than a small one, because the big one will stay in the fire longer and the small one reheats very quickly.</div></div> <div id="p153v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Softening <m>gold</m></h2>
Sometimes, you can find <m>gold</m> that is so dry that neither <m>cement</m> nor <m>antimony</m> can soften it.  Only <m>verdigris</m> can soften this <m>gold</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

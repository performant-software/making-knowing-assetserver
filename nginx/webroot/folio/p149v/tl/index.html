<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> who make large works and crockery use a turning lathe to get the model they wish in wood. Then with some <m>wax</m>, <sup><pro>the goldsmiths</pro></sup>model on top of this the masks, festoons, or anything that they wish. Then they mould the model in three, four, or several pieces.</div></div><div id="p149v_2"><div data-layout="center"> <h2><m>Gold</m> solder</h2>
They take on a <m>gold</m> penny a small pinch of refined <m>aloc</m>, as you would find in old sous. </div></div><div id="p149v_3"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Molding <al>flies</al></h2>
Large <al>flies</al> can be molded & cast. But you must apply underneath their wings some <m>wheat oil</m>, which dries quickly and firms them up & gives them a little thickness. The same thing can be done with <al>butterflies</al>, <al>cicadas</al>, <al>grasshoppers</al> & similar things. But to cast them more easily, you must set them on some leaf or bouquet. The others should be placed by hand on a very slender <m>silver</m> blade. You cannot keep your insects when they are dead, since they will dry out and their legs will break.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom"><m>Wheat oil</m> should be put underneath delicate things to make them more rigid & firm, & to make them hold their natural posture, since being weak & delicate, the tempered sand, adding weight to them, would change their form.</div></div><div id="p149v_4"><div data-layout="center"> <h2><al>Bats</al></h2> 
They have very thin wings and if they are large & dry and the wings are extended, you need a very big mold & it is not certain that the <m>metal</m> will run sufficiently; thus, when you want to mold some, choose the medium-sized ones & and arrange them so that they have  their wings are half folded, since in this way they will come out better. But be sure to apply, as you known, some <m>wax</m> on the side of the wings, so that the cast flows well.</div></div></folio></body></html>

When <m>wax</m> is too hard, one mixes in <m>turpentine</m> or a little <m>butter</m>, which <del>sont pl</del> renders the <m>wax</m> more amiable, and more appropriate than the<m>tallow</m> that the <pl>Italians</pl> put in, because one has to, often, put the tools in the mouth, which are better in <m>box wood</m> or <m>bone of hart</m>.</div></div><div id="p109r_2"><div data-layout="center"> <h2><m>Wax</m> for molding</h2>
Since the <m>wax</m> is molten, they have some <m>sulphur</m> in a spoon or crucible & pour it in the molten <m>wax</m>. And with the <m>sulphur</m> going to the bottom or staying on top, it stays where it is & mixes only its substance in the <m>wax</m>, & renders it more meltable when warming it, in such a way that having molded it, <sup>the <m>wax</m></sup> gently melts in the mold like <m>butter</m>, without leaving any blister or boil.  Also be warned to not give it too much heat.</div><div data-layout="left-top">If</div></div><div id="p109r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Molding <m>wax</m></h2>
So that your mold takes hold without repelling any surface on a form or figure in <m>wax</m><m>,</m> it is necessary to rub the <m>wax</m> with <m>oil</m> and soak your sand in lukewarm <m>water</m>, because cold <m>water</m> repels <m>oil</m> even more & will not make a good layer on the <m>wax</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">Rub the <m>oil</m> on very very lightly, <sup>use</sup> so little that it hardly appears at all. Then rub with some <m>spirits</m>. After soak your sand in lukewarm <m>water</m> so that it does not repel the <m>oil</m>.</div></div><div id="p109r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Forge bellows</h2>
It is better that at the end with the air chamber the bellows be set in some kind of bit of cloven board because they are more secure this way. Afterwards you can lightly secure them from the top.  It is necessary that the nozzles be four fingers above the bottom of the forge.</div></div><div id="p109r_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Molding <al>snakes</al></h2>
When you get them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove their teeth if you <x>think you might</x> want to keep them, because having had their teeth removed, it hurts their gums & mouths, & they can no longer eat.  You can keep <x>the snakes</x> in a barrel full of <m>bran</m> or even better of <m>earth</m>, in a cool place, or in a <m>glass</m> bottle.  And give them some live frog or other live animal because they do not eat anything <sup>that is</sup> dead. Also I have noticed that</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

Hairy animals are difficult to mold because hairs raise up & come out looking intermingled & in clumps. At the beginning, it is necessary to keep it flat with a drying agent & that makes it firmer.  And in this, the best thing to use is <m>wheat oil</m>, with which you will dawb it. Once cast, you will be able to repair it. The bodies of <m>butterflies</m> and <m>herbs</m> that have a <m>stem</m> & <m>leaves</m> that are flocked with capricious & downy<m>hairs</m> need to be daubed with the same <m>oil</m> to keep these flocks flat; likewise  <m>flowers</m> that have very delicate & thin <m>leaves</m> because dry <m>wheat oil</m> makes them and rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding anything presented to them, give them the downy head of the herb called <m>dandelion</m> to cast or a <pa>pappus</pa>, which comes from the seeds of <pa>burdock</pa> & takes flight at the slightest sigh of wind.</div></div><div id="p124r_1"><div data-layout="center"><h2><fr>Noyaulx</fr> for molding hollow</h2>
Animals of <m>gold</m> & <m>silver</m> are generally cast hollow to avoid weightiness, and costs as well, if they are not quite small. But in order to make the core & the <fr>noyau</fr>, the mold needs to be freshly molded and not dry.</div></div><div id="p124r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><al>Spider</al> web</h2>
It comes undone in <m>water</m> & because of this, cannot be molded in a <fr>noyau</fr>, but one casts the <m>spider</m> and then one draws the web <m>filaments</m> that they make in the fields stretched between blades of <m>grass</m>  on some <m>carton</m> with a stylus. One makes around it an edge of <m>paper</m>, glued to the <m>carton</m> & one casts with <m>tin</m> mixed with very little <m>lead</m>.</div></div><div id="p124r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Fine <m>gold</m> </h2>
There is a kind of <m>gold</m> which, even though it is very fine & unalloyed & has been passed through <m>aqua fortis</m> & <m>antimony</m>, is however so brittle that it hardly withstands the hammer. And the composition of <m>verdigris</m> mentioned above to make <m>gold</m> flow, makes it as <fr>doux</fr> as <m>lead</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

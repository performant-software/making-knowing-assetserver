And for this effect, one casts a medal of <m>fine tin</m>, which is harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves it in one half of the <tl>frame</tl>, & presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you will cast in your <tl>frame</tl> some <m>solder</m> described above, or another more meltable than <m>fine tin</m>. And thus, the second medal will melt & mold itself on the first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix some <m>lamp black</m> with <m>water</m>, & with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>, give a light coat of this to the medal, which remains in the <tl>frame</tl>, & leave to dry.

Mix <m>resin</m> to the <m>wax</m>. Once well blended, soften the mixture in hot <m>water</m> or <m>urine</m>. Then press <x>the foot or the hand</x> in the mixture in order to get an impress, then pour <m>plaster;</m> the cast will which will be clean and come off easily.</div> </div><div id="p160v_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Fine work made of <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m></h2>
You can mold flies by hand,without casting; the wings and the feet can be soldered, which you could not do with fine works of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, because they would melt. You can enamel the work made of <m>gold</m>.</div> </div><div id="p160v_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Catching crayfishes</h2>
On the end of a stick, attach pieces of liver or lung, from beef or mutton. Then hang a basket to the stick with a little string. Put the basket into water where crayfishes eat; they will soon aggregate on the flesh. Pull very gently your stick out of the water; the crayfishes which will try to return to the water will fall into the basket.</div></div><div id="p160v_a4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Catching passerines</h2>
If they sleep in the farmyard, like they commonly do, close to the house, let the closest window open, and put a lighted candle close to the window. The candle itself must be hidden, only its glimmer must be seen through the room and through the window; all the passerines will then lock themselves into the room. But the night must be very dark, without any moonlight.</div>  </div><div id="p160v_a5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Catching birds</h2>
During winter, when birds have molted, skin them and fill them with cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your birds on trees, have some <x>look like they are</x> singing, <x>look like they have assembled</x> and are numerous.</div><div data-layout="center">the oven must not be too hot. This <x>method</x> is good in the summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they <x>birds</x> could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the winter, because they dry by themselves.</div></div></folio></body></html>

Or else, with little <tl>shards of <m>wood</m></tl>, pierce them, or <del><fr>ma</fr></del> coat the joinings with some <m>clay</m>, & dry. Press <del>between them</del> your <tl><bp>hands</bp> joined between your<bp> two </bp>knees</tl>;  & not with a <tl>press</tl>, because the <tl><m>bones</m></tl> would burst. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see that it is well pressed tightly together & well imprinted.  And each time before replacing the piece, <fr>ponce</fr> with some <m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, for it makes it release well.  When you have cast, rub the medal with <m>oil</m> & with <m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal powder</m> & with a <tl>brush</tl>, to make it dull.  Guard against your medal being too greasy or <m>oily</m>, when you mold in <tl><m><al>cuttlefish</al> bone</m></tl>. When you have cast, leave it to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it brings with it some <tl><m>bone</m></tl>. And, cast moderately hot, something you will know when the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> is about to change its <del>good</del> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> red. The <ms>proportion</ms> of <m>lead</m> & <m>tin</m> is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult to come out, & of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or four grooves, <del>and make</del> & direct these grooves to the place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like directly on the head, for this attracts the <m>metal</m> & absorbs the figure best.  Shake your <tl>frame</tl> a little when you have cast, and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <m>Tin</m> that is too hot burns the <tl><m>bone</m></tl>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken out <del><fr>du mo</fr></del>hot from the <tl>mold</tl>, it risks breaking. </div></div></folio></body></html>

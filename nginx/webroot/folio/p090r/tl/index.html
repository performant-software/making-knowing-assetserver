I have pulverized <m>sal ammoniac</m>, well dried in the fire & in a hot <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>, and passed it through the <tl>double sieve</tl>, it became very fine. But to render it even thinner, I have crushed it dry on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Then I mixed it with <m>pulverized & finely ground iron dross</m>, in the same way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief, without being moistened <env>in the <tmp><fr>serain</fr></tmp></env>, or in the <env>cellar</env>, or otherwise with the <tl>napkin</tl>, &  it releases very neatly.</div></div><div id="p090r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Sand</h2>
<pro>Molders</pro> from <pl>Foix</pl> who cast their medals from the side, use <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m> and <m>calcined slate</m>. It is for very flat things.</div> </div><div id="p090r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>All sands can be rendered good</h2>
<pro>Artisans who work in big works</pro>, & who need to further their profit, by seeking things already prepared in nature, because it does not sell its wares to people, and to also save the time they would use for grinding finely & and for artificially preparing sands, seek <m>the one of the <del><fr>s</fr></del> <env>mine</env><del>s</del></m>, which is not too fat, having some <m>earth</m> in it, not too lean & consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled <env>from the depths of the sand-bed</env> in <fr>mattons</fr> & clods that show its natural compactness, which is quite difficult to break & which has a very small & delicate grain, & which is found <sn>soft when handling it between your <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl></sn>. And because the latter is only found <env>near the rocks in mountainous areas</env>, or <env>lean territories</env> & having <m><fr>arene</fr></m>, it cannot be found <del>in</del> <env>in the surroundings of all the <pl><fr>bonnes villes</fr></pl></env>, where <pro>artisans</pro> willingly gather themselves.  And thus, if they do not have it <env>close to their house</env>, they prefer to have it come from afar, like from <pl>Lyon</pl>, <pl>Venise</pl>, <pl>Parys near the Sainct Chappelle</pl> & similar places, rather than prepare it. However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the <m>sand from the <env>mine</env></m>.</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

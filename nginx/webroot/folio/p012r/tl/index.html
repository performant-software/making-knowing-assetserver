<m>Sulfur</m> is made beautiful mixed with <m>soot black</m> or with <m>pulverized sanguine</m>, which renders it harder and stronger. Having let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like <m>oil</m>, mix it with <m>verdigris</m>, and you <del><fr>m</fr></del> will cast in <m>plaster</m> very neat a <al>lizard</al>, or something else.</div> <div data-layout="left-top">You must not cast that which has not become well cooled & that which has not lost all its lumps & bubbles, and has not settled down well & become smooth like <del><ill></del> <m>water</m>. The <m>soot black</m> gives it a fine luster & makes it neater. The most beautiful yellow <m>sulfur</m> must be used, for the greyish & lively <m>sulfur</m> is not good. Do not cast <env>in wind</env> & <env>cold</env>, for it would become porous.</div></div><div id="p012r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><fr>Chimolee</fr></m></h2>
The <m><fr>terre chimolee</fr></m>, otherwise known as <m><pro>fuller</pro>â€™s earth</m>, from which they finish the <m>cloth</m>, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you want to reheat it, it must first be warmed, & reheat it gently on a low, indirect fire, & little by little, otherwise it would crack. Put the figure to reheat in a <tl>pot</tl> in an <tl>oven</tl>, or in a <tl>covered oven</tl>. It is very malleable, clean & fine. <add>You can make a cavity for animals of <m><fr>chimolee</fr></m> & cast <m>lead</m> in it.</add></div><div data-layout="left-middle">The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 <ms>days</ms> before you reheat it. When you mold & make a cavity from <m><fr>chimolee</fr></m>, do not press too hard, but softly, for it would break.</div></div><div id="p012r_3"><div data-layout="center"> <h2><m>Paper</m></h2>
The whitest & finest is the best. And when the cavity is quite clean, as of <m>sulfur</m> or <m>baked <fr>chimolee</fr></m>, it is made very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of <m>white</m> with a border of <m>gold</m> to imitate <m>alabaster</m>. And after you have applied the <m>white</m>, you can burnish it with the  <tl>tooth</tl>. But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to mix the <m>lead white</m> with <m>glair of egg</m> & <m>peelings from the <pa>fig tree</pa></m>. Or better, varnish your work with <m>white varnish</m>. In addition when you are molding with <m>paper</m>, as it starts to dry, burnish from the back with the <tl>tooth</tl>.</div></div><div id="p012r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Plaster</m></h2>
That from the <env>mountains</env> is greyer, and <del>the</del> the one from the region of <pl>Albi</pl> is whiter. It must be heated over a closed fire, such as a <tl>reverberatory furnace</tl> or <tl><fr>fours de barbiers</fr></tl>. And the most freshly cooked is the best. It must be finely ground on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>. After having prepared your cavity from <m>sulfur</m> or something else, & <m>oiling</m> it, & having enclosed it in a <corr>circle</corr>, temper not too thickly your <m>plaster</m> with <m>water</m>, & separate it well with your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, and if it makes lumps, throw in more <m>powder of the said plaster</m> & <del><ill></del> grind it with the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> until  it makes no more lumps. Then cast & sprinkle again with <m>plaster powder</m> & leave to set well, then scrape off the powder.</div></div></folio></body></html>

Very burnt sand loses its bond. <m>Slate</m> is reheated & molds neatly.  Next, it is true that often it becomes porous, like <m>burned earth</m> also does,  like <m>fat sand</m> also does.</div><div data-layout="left-top">I find that one ought not to knowck on very finely ground sands, for it shakes them loose, & <del>make</del> prevents them from releasing neatly. But one ought to press hard and moisten them sufficiently.</div></div><div id="p087v_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Magistra</m></h2>
<pro>Founders</pro> take the <m>roots of a young <pa>elm</pa></m> when it has sap, & boil it in <m>wine</m>, or better yet <m>vinegar</m>, and keep it <tmp>all year long</tmp> in a <tl>cask</tl>.</div> </div><div id="p087v_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Sand from the <env>mine</env> of <pl>Thoulouse</pl></m></h2>
 Casting sand coming from the <env>mine</env>, once passed through a <tl>double sieve</tl>, next put in with <m>melted resin</m>, burns & inflames & becomes all red & inflamed like <m>iron</m>. Once cold it is completely black and can be ground very finely on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Thus having prepared it & render it without asperity on the <tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl>, I moistened it with <m>beaten egg glair</m> & beat it well, until it was not pasty but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, & molded with it in <m>lead</m> & <m>tin</m> very neatly, but it wants to be well reheated & at ease.</div><div data-layout="center">Others beat it well in a <tl>mortar</tl>, in small amounts at a time, & thus it detaches and renders very finely. Then they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Then they grind it dry on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. And thus it becomes as if impalpable, and not too dried out,  <del>it</del> and it retains body & bond of the <m>earth</m> of which it is related, and is better than when it is very burnt. Once moistened with <m>egg glair wiped with a <tl>sponge</tl></m>, it releases <del>very neatly <fr>M</fr></del> very neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore, since then I experimented <del><fr>lexper</fr></del> with moistening it only with very strong <m>vinegar</m>. It released a figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that, moistening the finest in the same way like with <m>glair</m>  &  the lumpiest, to fill the <fr>chasses</fr> with <m>salt water</m> or <m>wine</m>, that they do not ally so well. Since they are of the same nature & are moistened the same, they embrace each other, & hold together one with the other.</div><div data-layout="center"><rub>To mold well</rub>, after having prepared your sands, mold <tmp>in a day</tmp>. Slowly reheat them <tmp>the next day</tmp>, then cast them on another. </div><div data-layout="left-middle">One ought to choose the one which is usually <del>as</del> in clods & lumps, well <env>deep in the earth</env>, for usually the one that is found <env>above</env> has too much <m>earth</m>, and the deep one is similar to <m>rock</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">I have molded with it in <m>pure lead</m> very <del>neatly</del> hot, & I had as an example the first very neat one, but the <m>vinegar</m> hardly gives it any bond, & thus it withstood only one cast. </div></div></folio></body></html>

The same sand that was used in the reheated <fr>noyaulx</fr>, composed of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> and <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> as is said, is excellent for casting in <tl>box molds</tl>, and I have experienced it thus: I crushed the pieces which had come out of <tl>core molds</tl> in a <tl>mortar</tl>, dragging the <tl>pestle</tl>, because this sand is very <fr>doulx</fr>. I did not pass it through the <tl>sieve</tl>, because the <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I ground finely upon <tl>marble</tl> what seemed to me too coarse. And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with <m>sal ammoniac water</m>, made of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, as much as the size of two <ms><pa>walnuts</pa></ms>, in a bottle of <m>common water</m> the same size as a <tl>bottle</tl> in which one boils <m>tisane</m>, or in a good <tl>pot</tl> of <m>water</m> so that you find the <m>water</m> fairly salty. I mixed throughout half a <ms>glass</ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, two <tl>silver spoonfuls</tl> of <m>spirits</m>. Having thus moistened the sand in such a way that it took hold well, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with <m>pulverized charcoal</m> with a <tl>file</tl> to rid it of <m>oil</m>, and all other <m>grease</m>. It is necessary to avoid them, for they would hinder good stripping. I blew on my medal & molded it, and the female part of the <tl>box mold</tl> once filled, I marked & made a line on the reverse & edge of the medal, & on the nearby sand as well. In order that the second <tl>box mold</tl> take the imprint thereupon to indicate the place for making the cast, <del>once filled</del><del>the female part of the box mold once filled</del> I uncovered the outline of the medal and pounced the whole side with <m>pulverized charcoal</m>, and then filled the male part with sand. <del>Once mad</del> I separated the <tl>box mold</tl> and did not hit the corners of the medal to make it strip, because that knocks the sand and makes it crumble. Rather I struck the back of the <tl>box mold</tl>, retaining the obverse of the medal on the bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it until the <tl>box mold</tl> had been dried out over fire. I lit a row of <m>charcoals</m> between two little <tl>trivets</tl> of <m>iron</m> in the form that you see, and put the back & reverse of <tl>box molds</tl> thereupon, & the imprint on top,  because in this way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should crack from being too moistened, it is on the back that they take the harshest fire, & the imprint remains safe & whole.</div> <div data-layout="left-top">For the best, it is necessary to reheat the sand that is used in the <fr>noyau</fr> rather than used it in the <tl>box mold</tl>, until it no longer contracts.</div><man><margin>left-top</margin>Excellent sand</man><div data-layout="center">Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, for covering the medal.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">For medals & flat things, the true heat of <m>lead</m> & <m>tin</m> is when it is melted gently.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">Note that I filled the <tl>box mold</tl> before pressing it, and did not hit it, but rather pressed it with the strength of my <bp>hands</bp> alone, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure your <tl>box mold</tl> that it does not shift at all, & if you put some moistened sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.</div> <div data-layout="left-bottom">Make the gate that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part.

Box molds dry out readily, & do not get reheated, because to reheat is properly to turn molds red & inflamed in the fire, and drying out is to let both molds dry, or make them evaporate their humidity, placing them before a fire of flames or one of charcoal. Molds de noyau reheat easily & box molds dry out.</div></div><div id="p111r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Latten</m> <m>smoke</m></h2>
It is good to reheat molds for casting <m>latten</m> in it, because this yellow <m>chalk</m>, which appears nevertheless to refill the molds, casts very neatly, being of the same nature.</div></div><div id="p111r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>For <m>red copper</m></h2>
When it's melted, it is good to throw in a little fine <m>tin</m>, because this makes it run.</div></div><div id="p111r_a4"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Clay earth</m></h2>
This, wet & well beat & kneaded as you know, is necessary for you to make the contour of your molds. But attend that it not be too soft. But likewise <x>attend that it be</x> sort of half dry such that it doesn't attack the hands at all, because otherwise it would attack your work. Always keep it in a damp place, and make some holes in it, and fill them with water, to keep it fresh.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">The gray <x><m>earth</m></x> is best which does not cleave at all.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">It is neater than <ill> of <m>lead</m>.</div></div><div id="p111r_a5"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Iron</m> wire</h2>
You have to be provisioned with different thicknesses according to the molds that you want to make, some large like packthread from <ill> & some thin, like the fat cords of a spinet, for small works. With it reheated, make clamps to close the molds & make points like needles of various lengths according to your need, to fasten the animal to the mold & hold it subject. Needles would not be good for this since your points must be hollow & of the same thickness throughout, except at the point. And then you have to make them as long as you have need. <m>Iron</m> wire is harder than that of <m>latten</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

Take one pound of <m>antimony</m>, half a pound of <m>black soap,</m> and half a pound of <m>Montpellier tartar</m>. Once it is all pulverized, you have to boil it in a <m>varnished earthenware pot</m> on a big <m>fire</m> as you stir it with a <m>piece of wood or iron</m>. The <m>soap</m> will burn off and be consumed by the <m>fire</m> and the rest will stay red. The quantity has to be reduced to a third. Then throw that on a <m>tile</m> and it will turn blackish. You will have to melt and pour that on a <m>tile</m> four or five times and then you will have <m>regulin from antimony</m>.</div><div data-layout="center">Others pulverise the <m>antimony</m> and mix it with equal quantities of <m>saltpeter</m> and powdered <m>tartar</m> and heat a <m>pot</m> or <m>crucible</m> until it is red hot, then add a little bit at a time, turning their back for fear of the smoke, and keep doing so until everything is added. They maintain the <m>fire</m> until everything is completely melted and melt that several times.</div></div><div id="p048v_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Lead</m>, <m>tin</m></h2>
They become brittle having been put back to melt, often or for a long time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one melts a <fr>saulmon</fr>, the <m>tin</m> thickens at the bottom if, while casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to melt a little <m>lead</m> <del>& the</del> or <m>tin</m> & <del><fr>remuer</fr></del> to renew at each melting. The <m>antimony</m> renders them breakable. The <m>looking glass tin</m> whitens them. <del>One</del> <pro>Pewterers</pro> put in <del>on the <m>fine tin</m></del> one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking glass tin</m> per one <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> & two <ms>lb</ms> & a half or three <ms>lb</ms> of <m>red & soft copper of cauldrons</m>, which is better than <m>latten.</m> There is <m>fine & soft tin</m> & <m>brittle tin</m>. The brittle one is cast in <tl><fr>grille</fr></tl> by the <pro>pewterers</pro> to sell it better. <del><fr>O</fr></del> They come out better & more neatly in <tl><m>stone</m> moulds</tl> than in a <tl><m>copper</m> mold</tl>, because <m>copper</m> is fat & sticks unless one heats the <tl>mold</tl> well or one casts large works. Three <ms>quarters</ms> of <m>lead</m> per one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>soft tin</m>, makes a very liquid line & proper for casting, which has a shine like a mirror. <m>Tallow for glass</m> lightens them. All things that lightens well <m>metals</m> & remove their thickness & dense nature & render them <del>like</del> liquid like <m>water</m>, render them proper for casting, for it is the thickness that prevents them from running. <m>Soft tin</m> is more even <del><fr>com</fr></del> than the <m>brittle one</m>, which is whiter and seems to be burnished like a mirror.</div> <div data-layout="left-bottom">To alloy well <m>tin</m> & <m>lead</m>, one needs to melt one by itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it often on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl> or the <tl><m>square tile</m></tl>. And when you will see it become well even <del>like</del> & shiny as if it were burnished, it is good. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much <m>lead</m> &  sometimes due to too much <m>tin</m>. There is some <m>tin</m> that has more <m>lead</m> than others. <m>Common tin</m> is the one that is mixed with <m>lead</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

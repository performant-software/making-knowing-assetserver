 <m>Sal ammoniac, well pulverized</m> <del><fr>mou</fr></del> & ground dry on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, molds very neatly & makes a very beautiful, & once mixed with <m>alabaster, pulverized</m> similarly, ii <ms></ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m> per <ms>lb</ms>, and moisten it <env>in a damp place</env> for two or three <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>, & so that when you take <bp>fistfuls</bp>, it holds together, without, however, attaching itself & being pasted to your <tl><bp>hand</bp></tl>. You will with it mold very neatly. But let it dry & reheat really well, leaving the <tl>mold</tl> inside, so that it acquires strength by reheating, for it becomes hard as <m>stone</m>, & and in this way is more certain to release well. Otherwise if you release before having reheated it, there would be danger of it crumbling in some place, because of its delicateness & fineness, even if the medal of high relief.  Once you have molded with it, pulverize it as before and put it back <env>in dampness</env>.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">All sand that releases well has body & sticks well. <m>Ammoniac</m> is fat and <del><fr>a va</fr></del> however, is <m><fr>areneux</fr></m> which makes it release well. There is no better bond than <m>salts appropriate for metals</m>, for once mixed in powder, they get moistened together & dry &reheat together.</div> </div><div id="p089v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><pro>Glassmaker</pro>'s white sand from the <env>mine</env></m>, mixed with <m>sal ammoniac</m></h2>
There is found in <pl>Cominge</pl>, near the <env>town</env> of <pl>Aurignac</pl>, a sand, white <del><fr>mai</fr></del>, like <m>salt</m>, and lean, that <pro>glassmakers</pro> & <pro>potters</pro> use, which renders impalpable crushed on  <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl> & is easy to crush. And once crushed, it resembles <m>calcined alabaster</m>. It molds very neatly, and I have not found any that molds as delicately as this one for low relief. It is excellent to mold en <fr>noyau</fr> without a frame, having crushed it impalpable with <m>gummed or pure water</m> on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, then placing it, thick as <m>mustard</m> or a little more, on the medal, smeared with a <m>oil either <pa>olive</pa>, <pa>walnut</pa>, even better <pa>spike lavender</pa></m>. But to do it better <del><fr>mo</fr></del>, let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or two <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Although, if you are in a hurry, you can heat it well, & it will not crack, if it is not put on too lightly. It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes some holes & bubbles, which it does not do when dried in the cold or at ease, rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it & it will withstand several casts. </div></div></folio></body></html>

Some people put <m>quicksilver</m> inside. But, if it is a little work, or fine & delicate foliage, that only has a slender issue, they make two errors: the first, that <m>quicksilver</m> by its heaviness can destroy some delicate tract inside in coming out, the other, that some bit will always linger inside that will make <x>other</x> <m>metals</m> sour & inhibit the perfection of the casting. It is true that if it is to empty the <tl>mold</tl> of some large animal that has big conduits & passages through which the <m>quicksilver</m> can easily exit, like of a bird or a serpent, one can indeed put some amount of <m>quicksilver</m> to break the calcinated bones of the animal in escaping, because of which the said <m>â˜¿</m> will empty out & not remain at all.</div><div data-layout="left-top">The <pa>asparagus</pa> stalk is so hard that most often it perseveres as charcoal. Because of this, do it rather dried out or wet it with <m>sulfur oil</m> & <m>turpentine</m>, or indeed cast the little branches separately & solder them onto a fat stalk drawn through with a wire.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">If the burnt thing has left behind some filth or ash, let it cool down a little, & with an <m>iron</m> <m>wire</m> wrapped in <m>cotton</m> that can bend with the cavities that you have, investigate. Clean & blow to a fault, either with a soft <tl>brush</tl> or a clipped <tl>brush</tl>.</div></div><div id="p117v_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><pa>Daisies</pa></h2>
They can be cast well in <m>gold</m>. But if you want to <m>enamel</m> them, you have to make them by hand & <m>enamel</m> them & then attach them. Otherwise, the <pa>leaves</pa> would be so pressured that it would encrust the <m>enamel</m>.</div> </div><div id="p117v_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Sand</m> that has already been used</h2>
Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with <m>stone allum</m>, you can use it in the mixture of other things & it can serve in place of <m>brick</m>.</div> </div><div id="p117v_a4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Core <tl>molding</tl> <m>wax</m> figures or <m>lead</m> medals</h2>
Rub them with <m>oil</m> with a <tl>brush</tl>. But be sure that it be so softly that your medal be barely wiped with it & that it hardly appear to have been greased. After rub it with <m>spirits</m> and heat the <m>water</m> with which you will wet your <m>sand</m>, that of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> & <m>alum</m>, so that being sort of lukewarm when you cast it, the <m>oil</m> will not refuse it, as it does with cold water, & do not forget to moisten your <m>sand</m> with it, mixing it always with a little <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">Medals <tl>molded</tl> in this way are very fine.</div></div><div id="p117v_a5"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Snakes' blood</m></h2>
If you have to cut some snake inside a <tl>mold</tl> in order to burn it, cut it far from the intake of the <tl>mold</tl> so that no <m>blood</m> at all remains, because it makes a crust that afterwards would not be taken away by the same <m>quicksilver</m> & removes impressions from your <tl>mold</tl>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

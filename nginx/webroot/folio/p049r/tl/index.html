One needs to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke their <tl>molds</tl> with a <m>resin candle</m> to cast neatly. The <m>antimony</m> makes the substance brittle & breakable. The <m>looking-glass tin</m> makes the work whiter, but not more runny, as for <m>tin</m>, it is good <del>to the</del> with <m>pure lead</m>. Those who make very neat <m>lead</m> casts, use <tl>bodkins</tl>. <pro>Pewterers</pro> cast in a <tl><m>copper</m> mold</tl>.

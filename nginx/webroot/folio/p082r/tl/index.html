To distribute the teeth proportionately on their wheels, they do not use a compass because there is no compass so fine that it can draw distances as small as those of the small wheels. But they make a platform (as they call it) out of <m>latten</m> <sup>that has been</sup> divided into various circles, & each <sup>of those</sup> circle<sup>s</sup> is divided into equal sections marked by a point. And each circle has a certain number <sup>of points</sup>, as <sup>for example</sup> one <sup>has</sup> 30, another 36, others 40 &. Then, on the pierced center of the platform, they place the little wheel. And on the center of the wheel <sup>there is</sup> a flat line or an alidade which points to the number on the circle that you want to mark on your wheel. Then with a point, they draw a line on the wheel. Then they return the alidade to the following point, & they thus go on marking it <sup>the dial</sup>. And to mark the points on the circles of their platform, they divide the circle in three & then divide this third part into as many sections as is necessary with regard to the total division of the circle. &, in this manner, they make the teeth's division & distribution as fine as they please.</div></div></folio></body></html>

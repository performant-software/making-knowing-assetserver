You must let the mold cool down rather than blow into it to try to get the ashes out.  Because when the mold is hot, the ashes stick to it, and when it cold, they separate from it more easily, and will exit by blowing with le vent a vapeur.</div></div><div id="p157v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Moulding a <al>bird</al></h2>
You must give it its pose. And to do so, place it on its side on a <m>clay</m> base and hide it in the aforesaid <m>clay</m> base and sink half the aforesaid <al>bird</al> in it, so that it is only showing one leg and foot, then you will apply <m>butter</m> to keep the feathers down and then apply some <m>spirits</m>.  Then cast it.  And having taken hold, clean and uncover what needs to be uncovered.  Because the feet are made of bones which are hard to burn, and which will not be able to be cleaned neither with <m>quicksilver</m>, nor by any other means, if the mold does not open, uncover the bottom of the foot and the toe, or the nail of the claw, and mold <sup>it with</sup>a separate piece.  Make a second cooking and open your mold and clean the bones.  Feet generally remain <sup>too</sup> weak to support the a heavy <al>bird</al>.  Because of this one adapts an <m>iron</m> thread in the foot mold which goes through the body before you cast.  In this way they are reinforced.  Some mold the wings in a frame.  Some mold the head and the aforesaid wings separately en noyau, then reattach and repair them to start shaping <sup><al>the bird</al></sup>, which will firstly have a rigid shape and support the tempered sand.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">They are skinned and filled with <m>cotton cloth</m>.  And for the best result, you must prepare it in the way that <pro>leather-workers</pro> do, so that they do not lose their comely feathers.  The preparation is made of <m>alum</m> and <m>flour paste</m>.</div></div><div id="p157v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Po<exp>ur</exp> f<exp>air</exp>e h<exp>…</exp> vin f<exp>…</exp>rs <x>?</x></h2>

One needs to heat <m>lavender spike oil</m> and as it begins to simmer, put in <m>powdered sandarac gum</m> so that it soon melts. And over a <m>charcoal</m> fire stir continuously until the <m>sandarac</m> is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said <m>varnish</m> on a <tl>plate</tl>. And if it is fatty when you handle it with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, it is ready. And for one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>lavender spike oil</m>, you will put five <ms>ounces</ms> of <m>pulverized sandarac</m>, although some only put in four <ms>ounces</ms>, but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is promptly dry. <pro>Framemakers</pro>, to avoid the trouble of polishing their <m>ebony</m>, varnish it with this, as do <pro>guitarmakers</pro>. This is not as appropriate for panels as that of <m>fine turpentine</m>, though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to varnish the landscape of a panel when <m>linseed varnish</m> was in use, because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of <m>turpentine</m>, one varnishes everything. You can put in <m>pulverized mastic</m> extracted in tears or otherwise, and it will be more dessicative in place of <m>sandarac</m>.</div><div data-layout="center">If you want to varnish on <m>plaster</m> or a wall, first put on your very hot <m><fr>colle de retaille</fr></m>, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall, & when you would put your <m>varnish</m> on, it would come off.</div><div data-layout="left-top"><m>Varnish of spike lavender oil</m> is not as appropriate for colors as that of <m>turpentine</m>, for <m>spike lavender oil</m> <del>makes them die</del> <add>eats away at</add> the colors since it is too penetrating.</div></div><div id="p004r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>To remove <m>varnish</m> from an old panel that has yellowed & varnish it anew</h2>
Take <m>white soap</m> & <m><tl>sieved</tl> ashes</m>, & soak both in <m>water</m>. And with a <tl>sponge</tl>, take the said <m>ashes</m> & <m>soap</m> & rub the panel with them. And as you see that the old <m>varnish</m> is removed, throw a <tl><ms>bucket</ms></tl> of <m>water</m> against the panel to clean it. Next put it for <ms><tmp>a quarter of an hour</tmp></ms> <env>in the sun</env> to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel dries, you can apply your <m>turpentine varnish</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">Make sure the colors do not come off.</div></div></folio></body></html>

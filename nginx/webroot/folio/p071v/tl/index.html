To a <ms>half lb</ms> of <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>, put in 4 <ms></ms> of <m>sandarac</m> & <m>mastic, pulverized subtly</m> . And first, boil your <m>oil</m> in a <tl>pot</tl> on a <tl>chafing dish</tl>, and then mix in little <add>by little</add> the aforesaid <m>gums</m>, stirring continually with a <tl>small stick split and quartered at the tip</tl>, & when you do not collect <m>gum</m> with the tip, that is to say that it is totally melted  & that your <m>varnish</m> is done.  And to render it clearer, put into the concoction a little lump of <m>camphor</m>. It is true that with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> will be good, clear & not fatty, otherwise your <m>varnish</m> will be worth nothing. You can test it <del><fr>d</fr></del> by soaking some <m>paper</m> in it & heating it. If the <m>oil</m>, which will evaporate, leaves the <m>paper</m> clean, without <del>being</del> a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is fatty.</div></div><div id="p071v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><al>Sheep</al> fat</m></h2>
In a certain part of <pl>England</pl>, the <al>sheep</al> that graze there have very yellow <m>fat</m> and are nevertheless just as good as others.</div></div><div id="p071v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><al>Spider</al></h2>
There are no <sup>spiders</sup> in <pl>Ireland</pl>, & if one touches them with some <m>wood</m> that they have there, they die. That is why some rich people from <pl>England</pl> make their floors with this <m>wood</m>, & in this way, they do not have any spiderwebs.</div></div><div id="p071v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Sand</h2>
The <m><fr>cimol√©e</fr></m> is very good for casting in <m>copper</m>, but one ought not take <m>the one from <pro>cutlers</pro></m>, because it is only <m>sludge</m>, but rather the one of those who <del><fr>moulent</fr></del> mold large shears.</div><div data-layout="center"><m>Pierres de filieres</m>, which <pro>knife grinders</pro> use for whetting, mold very neatly, once scraped, for <m>lead</m>.

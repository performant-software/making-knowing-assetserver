<m>Sugar</m> is fatty, and, with it, round things and large muscles are cast well but fine and delicate things <x>are cast with</x> difficulty. However, try well-purified <m>sugar</m>. The <m>plaster</m> mold must be soaked in <m>water</m> for a full night or a full day before casting <m>sugar</m> so that it <x>the mold</x> is saturated with <m>water</m> and does not soak up the <m>syrup</m> <x>the <m>sugar</m> mixture</x>. The <x>plaster</x> mold must also be stripped very well from it <x>the sugar</x>, because <m>sugar</m> is aigre and brittle. Thus, do not cast anything with <m>sugar</m> which is not stripped easily from it, and which can not be neatly molded in two parts to open as will be needed. If you want to mold a grape, you must get it when it is very fresh; because if it is withered, it <x>the cast</x> will look the same. See to it, thus, that you make your molds in the natural season for each thing <x>fruit</x>. Grapes that one wants to cast in <m>sugar</m> are man-made, either with <m>wax</m> or <m>earth</m> or with grapes molded with melted <m>wax</m>, on some dish <x>plaste & chose pleine</x> in a way so that they are pressed closely together and easily stripped from it. And only a half <x>of the grapes</x> should be molded. Or, if you have some of those grapes called chauches or sauvignons which have well-pressed grapes, set half of the grapes in the dish of <m>clay</m>, and cast on the other half, and if any grape is not stripped from it, pluck it out. Note that a grape whose grapes are set apart and separated cannot mold well in either <m>sugar</m> or <m>metal</m> because the ends of the cluster are so fine. Similarly, if the grape is kept, that it cannot hold the bunched grapes. Therefore, a hollow should be cast, which you will not be capable of if the grape is not close together and without having them spread apart.</div><div data-layout="top">to cast and brittle, and <x>it</x> breaks when dry</div><div data-layout="left-top"> In order to mold pears and apples in <m>sugar</m>, do not cast. Rather, fill half of the mold, and then join the two <x>halves</x>, and keep turning <x>it</x> until the <m>sugar</m> is solidified and cold. Do not mix anything in the mold except the reheated <m>plaster</m>, as you know.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">The mold needs to have been soaked in cold <m>water</m> for one full day and night and <x>the mold</x> must be damp when you cast in <m>sugar</m>.</div> <div data-layout="left-bottom">The sign that the <m>syrup</m> or the melted <m>sugar</m> has boiled enough in the <m>water</m> for casting fruits is when it makes threads when shaking it. And if it passes this point, it will not be good because it will make <x>it</x> damp. If the <m>sugar</m> corrodes itself, throw a bit of <m>amidin</m> in the mold or rub it with an <m>almond</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

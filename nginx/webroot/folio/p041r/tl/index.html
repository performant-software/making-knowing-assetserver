It renders itself fat once beaten and also mixed with <m><al>horse</al> dung</m>. <m><pro>Potter</pro>'s earth</m> would be too fat and would crack & would not hold in the fire, but one needs to mix it with <ms>half the quantity</ms> of sand and a <ms>quarter</ms> or a <ms>fifth</ms> of <m><add><al>horse</al></add> dung</m>. And leave it to dry, then powder it, then <tl>sift</tl> it to render it fine & cleansed, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The <m>dung</m> renders the <m>earth</m> more amenable & easier to deal with, but it is necessary that it be well free of <m>straw</m> & other things. And when the <m>earth</m> is very fat, one needs to give it more sand  & more <m>dung</m>. But one does find fat varieties of <m>earth</m>, themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, make them so artificially. One always needs to reheat the <m>earths</m> before casting.</div></div><div id="p041r_02"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Garden lily</h2>
If it is broken during its first blossom, it will not grow or bloom until the following year, and I believe it is the same for bulbous flowers <x>in general</x>.</div></div><div id="p041r_03"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Sand</h2>
The sand chosen <del>cast</del> for casting should be neither so lean that it has no stickiness, nor too fat. And even if it is found <env><m>in nature</m></env>, however, it is not everywhere. And if you are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with <m>fat earth</m>, for the sand does not want any of that, for it makes it very porous. But you can make it bindable with <m>brick well ground</m> on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, or <m>plaster</m> or <m>calcinated alabaster</m> or something similar, or the <m>burned marrow of <al>ox</al> horn</m> or <m>burned asphalt</m>. If you grind it quite finely on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, it <del><fr>s</fr></del> acquires stickiness better & then you can burn it with <m>asphalt</m> or mix it with a <ms>quarter part</ms> of <m>tripoli</m>. Guard against <m>bread</m> falling into your sand because it makes it very porous.</div> <div data-layout="left-middle">Try mixing in <m>soot black</m>.</div></div><div id="p041r_04"><div data-layout="center"><h2><al>Ducks</al></h2>
Young domestic ones do not grow for a month after hatching but remain in this state. But after, they soon grow up, even if they go into the water. They are fed boiled <m>millet grains</m>, to which are added crumbled <m>bread</m> and finely chopped <m>lettuce</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

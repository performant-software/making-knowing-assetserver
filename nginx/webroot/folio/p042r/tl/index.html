The <tl>mould of <m>earth</m></tl>  is reheated until sometimes it becomes red hot, for otherwise the <m>metal</m> would spatter & would not do anything good. And similarly, the <fr>noyau</fr> on the inside should be very reheated, & mixed with <m>charcoal powder</m>.</div></div><div id="p042r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Wax</m> for seal and imprint</h2>
For the large <m>wax</m> seals, one needs to have <m>tepid water</m> always ready & <del><fr>apre</fr></del> to keep your <m>wax</m> in it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your <bp>hands</bp> to render it very even, for otherwise the <m>water</m> that would get in between would prevent it from coming together. Next you will imprint whatever you want and put three or four pieces of <m>paper</m> on, & with a <tl>stick</tl> <del>you</del> even & round like a <tl>pestle</tl>, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it will attach itself to the <m>paper</m>, which will help you lift it off the <tl>mold</tl>. Thus you will imprint better than if you dripped it molten. You can carve the figures & gild them, silver them, & paint them with <m>colors in varnish</m>, & transfer them onto a base of <m>glass</m> painted with <m>colors in turpentine & mastic</m>. And if you want to apply these plates by inlaying, do it with <m>gum ammoniac </m> mixed with <m>vinegar</m>, and you will have good <m>glue</m>.</div></div><div id="p042r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Casting in <m>plaster</m></h2>
Melt some <m>wax</m>, & with a large <tl>brush</tl>, coat the relief of which you want to have the cavity, as if you wanted to paint it. And a light crust <del>upon which <fr>qu</fr></del> will be formed, upon which you will cast <del>you</del> <m>plaster</m>, to give it body and strength. Next, in the <m>wax</m> cavity, you will also cast your <m>plaster</m> in order to have your relief, & it will come out very easily, thanks to the <m>wax</m>. This is done more often for large pieces in high relief than for others.</div> </div></folio></body></html>

<al>Buntings</al> sing during the night if they are left in the cool open air, but they are better suited to fattening for fine tables than for singing. <al>Chaffinches</al> are prone to blindness, and their eyes swell at the beginning of August. <al>Goldfinches</al> love <m>lettuce seeds</m>, and you can catch them in gardens on seedy lettuce using two <m>lime-twigs</m>. But because such a daily fayre would be too expensive for them, they are usually fed with <m>hemp-seed</m>. The <al>owsell</al> is purged with a <al>spider</al>, which you must give it once a week, so that it doesn't become too strong. The <al>lark</al> is purged with <m>dry mortar</m>, composed of <m>lime</m> and sand, to keep it from becoming too strong and fat. Small young birds are purged with the same <m>dry mortar</m>, by placing small lumps of it in their cages. The <al>cuckoo</al> lays its eggs in the nest of the <al>bunting</al>, otherwise know as <al>verdaule</al>. This bird is very simple-minded, I have previously let two go, which after a few days returned to their cage. To feed young <al>goldfinches</al>, it is necessary to crush <m>almonds</m> with very fine <m>breadcrumbs</m>, and <m>lettuce seeds</m> or <m>hemp seeds</m>. For <al>linnets</al>, some <m>rapeseed</m>.</div></div><div id="p050v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Hot-worked <m>steel</m> and files</h2>
The <m>steel</m> that <pro>blacksmiths</pro> and other <pro><m>iron</m> workers</pro> commonly use is not refined like that from <pl>Germany</pl> or <pl>Biscay</pl>, which is hardened in a <m>molten iron</m> bath, but among the <m>iron</m> in bars which is transported by flatboat from the forges of <pl>Foix</pl> and elsewhere, some is harder, whiter and more refined than the rest, as it comes from the mine. And the <pro>workers</pro> choose it and use it like the other <m>steel</m>. And because it consists of <m>common iron</m>, they call it strong <m>iron</m>. But it is not of such good quality as purified <m>steel</m> like that from <pl>Germany</pl> and <pl>Biscaye</pl>, which is sold in small beads. Some hot-work their <m>steel</m>, giving it a heating and then dipping it into a large quantity of <m>water</m>, then forging it. And fine <m>steel</m>, which is brittle, does break and crumble, whereas <m>iron</m> can be pulled out.  Thus they separate the finest <m>steel</m>, which with another heating they make into a mass. The <pl>Germans</pl> make their files from strong <m>iron</m>.</div> <div data-layout="left-bottom"><m>Steel</m> is applied to tools not on both sides, but underneath the part where one sharpens and whets them, and this part must be made of very soft <m>iron</m>.</div> <div data-layout="left-bottom"><pl>Levantines</pl> refine our own <m>steel</m> because their country provides them with none, and they reheat it in a pot with <m>bitumen</m> etc.</div></div></folio></body></html>

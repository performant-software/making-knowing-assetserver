Not only <m>ash <sup>from <pl>Acre</pl></sup></m> & <m><fr>azure d’Acre</fr></m> but mainly <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m> which one needs to choose to be very delicate, <del>for it</del> otherwise you will not <del><fr>v</fr></del> be able to work with it except with great work, and even then you need to thin it with <m>turpentine</m> to give it body, and mix it with a little  <m>lead white</m>. Any <m>azure</m> does not want to be ground or washed for it loses color & becomes wan. But putting it powdered on your <tl>palette</tl>, you will thin it little by little either with <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> or <m>turpentine oil</m>, <corr>dipping</corr> a <tl>knife point</tl> in <m>oil</m>, then <corr>tempering</corr> it little by little on the said <tl>palette</tl>.</div></div>  <div id="p059r_1"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Shadows</h2>
The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear & thoroughly softened & then the last ones very dark to accentuate well. The <pl>Italians</pl> usually make three shadows, the first one, of light, very clear, the second one darker & the third ones quite strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from the darkest to the clearest.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">The <m>varnish</m> is more beautiful on the panel when the color has imbibed well.</div></div><div id="p059r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Azure</m></h2>
<m>Azure</m> is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel <del>without</del> with <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> with which it has been first thinned, without putting in <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>. And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will not shine, thus appearing to be well-imbibed.

In a frame, If you cast it hot, <m>sand</m> will bubble; thus you have to just dry it.</div><div data-layout="left-top">I have tried to prevent molds blended with <m>sand</m> from cracking when annealed, and thus not get any with flaws that crack.</div></div><div id="p132v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Crocum ferry</m></h2>
After I processed it with <m>vinegar</m> and reddened under heat, I had it ground very finely on the <m>porphyry</m>, until there could be no ruggedness felt under the nails. Then I soaked it in very good <m>vinegar</m> for 2 or 3 days, stirring the mixture several times a day. Then I boiled it and made it red-hot in a pot, and put the whole thing into an air furnace. I obtained a mass full of eyes, but that crumbled finely between the fingers. I mixed half as much as <m>stone alum</m> in the sand. I diluted the sand very thinly, and molded a very small lizard, which molded very cleanly and finely. <m>Crocum ferry</m> does not make the mold harder, but makes it firmer. When your mold is soft and fat under your nail, it means that the <m>crocum</m> is good, very fine and well prepared. You can add any quantity of <m>crocum</m>, your mold will not be damaged because it is a friend of gold. I think it would be the same with <m>silver</m>. And in order that molds made with it do not crack, make it with needle filings.</div> <div data-layout="left-top"><m>Sand</m> is better made with <m>distilled vinegar</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">You can add this <m>sand</m> to the molds you want to use to cast <m>silver</m>, because it make molds firmer, and when you scratch it, you will find it a bit rougher than the other molds not made from this <m>sand</m>. You mold very clean with this <m>sand</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">You can use this one for all molds, because it prevents them from cracking and bursting when heated. This <m>sand</m> withstands several casts for molding flat medals. Sand from <m>steel</m> or <m>needle filings</m> is redder and better.</div></div><div id="p132v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Gilding animals casted with <m>silver</m></h2>

Those which are found in the <env>sea</env> and similarly those in which certain small crabs dwell are very beautiful for grottoes, if they are stripped of the first crust of their shell with <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m>, for they truly appear to be made of <m>mother-of-pearl</m>.</div></div><div id="p118r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>For removing flaws and flashing from things <tl>molded</tl> in a <tl>core mold</tl></h2>

You should have: a large basin full of <m>water</m> to dip the molds into in order to open them, a tankard full of <m>common water</m>, a dish to temper the <m>sand</m>, a small <m>wooden</m> spoon to pick up the mixed <m>sand</m> in the dish.</div><div data-layout="left-top">To make handles for your large oil brushes, if you do not have large enough <m>feather pipes</m>, take two of them, & melt them & join them together.</div> </div><div id="p112r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Decoction of <m>sands</m></h2>

Once you have reheated your <m>sand</m>, that is the <m>plaster</m>, the <m>stone alum</m> & the <m>brick</m>, & once you have finely filtered them through a <m>cloth</m> sieve,  except for the <m>stone alum</m> which should be ground in a mortar.</div></div><div id="p112r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Killing the animal to mold</h2>
You must have been careful not to hurt it while capturing it. If you have a stock <x>of animals</x> and you wish to keep them for a long time, place it in a <m>glass</m> bottle with <m>bran</m> or in a large barrel half full of damp & fresh <m>earth</m>. Give them frogs to eat, live & and not dead, because should you keep them without feeding them, they would wither & become emaciated, & their skin would become saggy and wrinkled. Therefore, the sooner after its capture you mold it, the better it will come out. And kill it in the following manner: place it in a clean bottle or vessel so that <x>the animal</x> does not carry any <m>dust</m>; fill <x>the bottle</x> with enough good <m>vinegar</m> & <m>urine</m> so as to cover <x>the animal</x>. Shake <x>the bottle</x> & torment <x>the animal</x> inside there until it is dead which should take an hour or half an hour. But if you are in a hurry</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">To know if <x>the animal</x> is quite dead, take it out of the <m>vinegar</m> and take it by the tail. If it moves its tail, do not mold it because it still has feelings, & when pricking <x>its members</x>, it would remove itself & harm the mold.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">Water snakes do not bite much.</div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

Pound some of the kind of  <m>vinete</m> or <m>lapathum acutum</m> that is red-veined, which is called <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m>, and apply it on the bleeding person's forehead. This herb is a strong dye & makes beautiful violet.</div></div><div id="p038v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Beautiful artichokes</h2>
You need to trim them every year so that only one stem is left, and water them a lot. Also plant some more every year, because the second year they will bear very beautiful fruits.</div></div><div id="p038v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Planting trees </h2>
It is said that rarely a tree planted on Saint Paul's day will fail to take. To cover the young shoots, oxen manure is very appropriate, for it doesn't come apart in the rain like earth.</div>  </div><div id="p038v_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Merchants </h2>
Those who retail velvet and other materials do not keep double-entry books because they sell in small quantities and <sup>recording</sup> these details would be too much effort. They only have their sales book and account books. But those who sell in bulk and those who traffic in woad have a double-entry book.</div></div><div id="p038v_6"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Crimson</h2>
Because one aulne costs seven or eight lb. to dye, they use <sup>cloth</sup>worth seven or eight francs. But if one wants something beautiful, one should buy some white cloth worth fifteen francs an aulne and dye it with some pure crimson woad & a little cochineal. Black fabrics are very fine because the dye is inexpensive.</div></div></folio></body></html>

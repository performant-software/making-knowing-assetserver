Mold them in two or three castings; being annealed, your mold will open, and it will be easier to extract the <m>charcoal</m> from inside. </div><div data-layout="left-top">Try <x>this</x></div>  </div><div id="p131r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>molded letter <m>paper</m></h2>
Write with some <m>ink</m> well thickened with gum or any other <m>color dye</m> which has body, and which is not erased if dampened with brandy.

Model any drawing in half relief on a flat <m>slate</m> in order to set it on round or flat things.

You need to keep your dog attached; when it does what you command, to win its love, give it a piece of <m>cheese</m> that was held under the armpit.

Wax representations made from <m>white lead</m> and <m>cerussite</m> are not made to be burned and melted in a mold where you want to cast <m>silver</m> and <m>gold</m>; this would make it brittle. Moreover if you use such a mold, the <m>wax</m> would be stripped thanks to the violence of the fire which makes it boil, and the mixture made of <m>cerrusite</m> or any other metal would attack the mold.

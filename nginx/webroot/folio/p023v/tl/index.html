When the sausage is filled, dip it gently in two <ms>parts</ms> <m>vinegar</m> and one of <m>spirits</m>, to moisten the <m>canvas</m> but not the <m>powder</m>. Next, leave the aforesaid <m>canvas</m> to dry completely, and then you need to attach to the sausage a long <m>string</m> or <m>cord</m> <ms>twice as long as the sausage</ms>, but you must not tie it to the sausage but make it touch the two ends and sew it to the sausage in a few places in the middle. Next you need to smear all of the sausage with very good <m>turpentine</m>, and at one end, where you will want to join to the <m>mortar</m>'s fuse for firing, you can sew or tightly attach with a selvage of <m>canvas</m> as large as one <fr><ms>empan</ms></fr> which should also be well soaked in <m>turpentine</m>, and this selvage should be cut in the middle so that it can be fastened and wrapped around the <m>mortar</m>, and you must attach it so that the tip of the sausage that is open will be joined to the fuse of the <m>mortar</m>. Then you need to place a lot of tightly-packed <m>powder</m> onto the fuse of the <m>mortar</m>. And next, the person outside of the ditch should draw the small <m>string</m> and <m>cord</m> that is joined to the sausage so that it is extended mid-way, but not so much that it is detached. And if there is <m>water</m> in the ditch, it will be necessary to support the sausage with a fork. Then, having placed himself and others in safety, the person who holds the tip of the sausage will be able to fire.</div></div> <div id="p023v_1"><div data-layout="center"><m>Mortars</m> that one wants to fix on doors or <m>iron</m> gates are sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 <ms>lb</ms>.

In order for the pipe to not hurt children at all, or those with swollen or protruding hemorrhoidal veins, one covers the pipe with a parcel of <m>chicken entrail</m> & fold it over the end, & in this way, one gives the enema.</div></div> <div id="p103v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Cast</h2>
<m>Tin</m> retracts once thick, thusly it is best to cast it thin & to make two pieces out of one, then <m>solder</m> <add>them</add> if needs be. One uses a strong piece of <m>taffeta</m> to <tl>sieve</tl> the fine sand, with which one first covers the medal, the <ms>thickness of a <cn>teston</cn></ms>.</div></div> <div id="p103v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>To make colors fluid</h2>
Mix some <m>vinegar</m> with a bit of <m>bile</m>, & put it into a <m>glass</m> bottle, & if you want to preserve it for a long time, add some <m>salt</m> & mix some of this with your colors & that will make them flow.</div></div> <div id="p103v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Earwax</m></h2>
If you take enough with the tip of an ear picker & you sieve it with foam of <m>urine</m>, which often forms in <sup>the <m>urine</m></sup> of  those who have a headache, all the foam will dissipate.</div></div><div id="p103v_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Enamels</m></h2>
To well recognize their difference and their true color by candlelight, it is necessary to put the candle behind a <m>crystal</m> mirror, or a <m>glass</m> globe or jar full of <m>water</m>, because this light is like sunlight.</div></div></folio></body></html>

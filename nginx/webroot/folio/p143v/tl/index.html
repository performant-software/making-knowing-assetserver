In this way, because you are casting in <m>wax</m>, there is no danger chipping any part of the molded animal.  It's quicker to make the <m>wax</m> casting conduits thus, because in this way <sup>you can</sup> cast the second mold after <sup>the first</sup>, rather than wait to do them <sup>the conduits</sup> after the mold has been recooked, because then, if possible, you will need to have everything ready.  You need to heat well, and even redden the molds where there are <m>wax</m> conduits so that they melt and leave nothing inside.</div></div> <div id="p143v_1"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Openwork carcanets</h2>
You can mold them en noyau like <al>crayfish</al>, first with one side being made higher with <m>clay</m>, which is hollow, and then you open <sup>it</sup> from the other side and make the second casting.  You can just as well cast en chassis, provided that they release well. If they do not, you can do a rough cast in <m>wax</m>, or you can fill up the cavities which do not release well with <m>wax</m> or <m>clay</m>.</div> </div><div id="p143v_2"><div data-layout="center"> <h2><m>Iron</m> filings </h2>
Because usually <m>filings</m> are mixed with impurities, it is good to heat them over fire to burn the filth and then wash them in clear <m>water</m>. In this way, the dirt will rise to the top of the <m>water</m>, which you will throw out, and the good filings will go at the bottom.</div></div><div id="p143v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Carnations</h2>
Because those that you usually cast are generally quite big, they are heavy.  And so for these, you make them with <m>silver</m> leaf or slivers.</div></div></folio></body></html>

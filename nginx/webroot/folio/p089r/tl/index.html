I pulverised them separately & finely ground them on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, as much as I could. Then I mixed <ms>as much of one as the other</ms> & reworked them on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Next I moistened it in <tl><m>paper</m></tl>, folded in a wet <tl>napkin</tl>, which is made faster than in the <env><tmp><fr>serain</fr> of the night</tmp></env> or in the <env>moisture of the cellar</env>. And I have not found anything else which releases more neatly than this one. It wants to be rather humid. And if you want to cast very thin, make sure it is very hot. It came out very neatly in <m>soft tin</m>, like the first one, and withstood several casts. For <m>tin</m>, I believe that it is not necessary to seek a better one, nor for <m>fine lead</m> also, which comes out almost as neatly as <m>tin</m>. <del><fr>Tou</fr></del> the <m>bone of the foot of <al>oxen</al></m> is always so lean on its own that, without being mixed with one or two parts of some <m>fat sand</m> &having bond such as <m>tripoli</m>, <m>salts</m>, <m>felt</m>, <m>ashes</m> & similar things, it would not release, & would not mold neatly for it crumbles.</div> </div><div id="p089r_a2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Reheating or drying a molded <tl>frame</tl></h2>
Always put the most delicate part, such as the face, above, so that nothing falls in it that could hinder your fusion.</div> </div><div id="p089r_a3"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Natural sand</m></h2>
It does not want to be reheated for <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>, <del><fr>m</fr></del> and is better very new & fresh.</div></div></folio></body></html>

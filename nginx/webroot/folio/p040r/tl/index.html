If your <m>glass</m> pane is bulging as if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When you apply your <m>turpentine</m> colors to your <m>glass</m> panes, first place them on a hot tile &, once they are hot, spread your colors & leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your <m>tin</m> sheet.</div></div><div id="p040r_1"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Dye</h2>
Some take the root of <pa><la>Lapathium acutum maius</la></pa>, which looks like <pa><pro>monk</pro>â€™s-rhubarb</pa> or <pa>sorrel</pa>, & using the root, which is yellow in summer, they dye threads & similar things.</div></div><div id="p040r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m><la>Aqua fortis</la></m></h2>
Some put <del>on</del> for four pounds of <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m> matter <del>four</del> that is in the <tl>retort</tl>, four ounces of common <m>water</m> in the container, which is better than putting it into the <tl>retort</tl>. The <m>alum</m> is de-phlegmed & calcined such that the <m>water</m> does not have as many dregs.

Because <m>silver gilt</m> does not fear fire, it is cut into lozenges flat<del><ill></del> on one side, then they are joined together in a star shape with a paste of crushed <m>enamel</m>, which is then melted & the <m>enamel</m> is gilt with <m>gold</m> leaf and then reheated.</div></div><div id="p040r_5"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Grottos</h2>
To fill some empty place that cannot be laden with hanging rocks, one puts a piece of thick <m>parchment</m> close to the fire, which shrinks & crumples. Then one paints it with distemper, then in <m>oil</m>. Next one affixes it.</div></div></folio></body></html>

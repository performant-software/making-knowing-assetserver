It is said, at the beginning of the book where you can see it, that it is made with  <m>galipot</m>.</div></div><div id="p097r_2"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Gilding</h2>
One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very <tl>soft file</tl> such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heat them, & pass them as said. But to gild & gild with <m>silver</m>, they ought not to pass, except maybe a little towards blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a wood block & with some <tl>tweezers</tl> one layers the <m>gold</m> & one makes it sit with <m>bloodstone</m>,which is quite clean & rubbed with <m><fr>pott√©e</fr></m>. And when the guards are cold, one reheats them, then one layers the <m>gold</m> as above. And first one gives <del><fr>de</fr></del> two layers, until the entire guard is well-adorned. And next one reheats as at the beginning, & one gives the third covering of <m>gold</m>. Then one burnishes very thoroughly and with great force with a large <m>bloodstone</m>. <del>And</del> But note that <add>to</add> burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to know this, <sn>one smells it & brings it close to the <bp>nose</bp></sn>. For one ought not to touch with the <bp>fingers</bp>, but one <del>grasps</del> picks it up from on top of the warm <m>ashes</m> with a small <tl><m>iron</m> rod</tl>, which has been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is entirely well-polished, one rubs it very well with a <tl><m>white linen</m></tl>, and the <m>gold</m> needs to be thicker & stronger than for <pro>painters</pro>. A <ms>quarter</ms> is worth fifty or LX <cn>s<exp>ols</exp></cn>.</div></div><div id="p097r_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Gilding with <m>silver</m></h2>
One needs to prepare the guards & whiten them with a <del><fr>lince </fr></del> <tl>file</tl>, a little coarser <del>for</del> than for <m>gold</m>.  And one makes them pass to grey, as for gilding. And when they are warm, one needs to double the <m>leaf of silver</m>, then divide it with a <tl>knife</tl>, next cover the guard with it, with <del><fr>un petit</fr></del> <tl>tweezers</tl> & a small <tl>burnisher</tl>. And then reheat & apply them, until they are all gilded in <m>silver</m>. Next one needs to cover them for the third time, with the <m>leaf</m> doubled as has been said, then burnish them very strongly & with good strength, not with the <m>bloodstone</m>, but with a strong <tl>burnisher</tl>, just as the <tl>burnisher</tl> ought not to burnish <m>gold</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

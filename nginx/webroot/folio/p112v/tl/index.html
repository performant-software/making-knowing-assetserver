Having gotten in some fat <m>earth</m> called <m>clay</m>, that should be grey, because that is the best one, or another that will bind well & will be well prepared & beaten, so that it is malleable without being damaging your hands or the work, make a lazagne, or a pancake shape, of this <m>clay</m> equally flattened with a rolling pin, which <pro>pastry-makers</pro> use so that it is slightly thicker than a poulc.  And on this pancake, affix your animal, making it as life-like as possible & the way in which it is naturally shaped. And firstly, with a good needle, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, & up to the top bone of the head. Then take the needle out & in its place & its hole, put the point of an <m>iron</m> wire, of such a length that it suffices to maintain the head of the animal as high as it must be, & if the skin gets in <del>&</del> when you put in the wire, take it out with the edge of your small pincer, & arrange the skin as it was before. Pierce the other end of the wire in the sheet of <m>clay</m>. In this way the head will be held high, which will make it more graceful & proud. Arrange afterwards, the rest of the body, & the legs, & the curling as you think will look best. And so that it is secure & does not move when you put in the sand, secure the legs & the body with little points of <m>iron</m> wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp needle. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, making sure that the points going through the animal are fixed in the <m>clay</m> sheet, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal by a</div><div data-layout="left-top">Take a needle of fine <m>steel</m>, & which will be the sharpest you can find,  so that with it, when you make your first hole in order to place the wire threads, it will pass through without effort, & take care not to rudely insert the wire or take skin with it.  Then put a thicker wire in the thick bits <x>of the animal</x> & the thinner wire in the thinner bits. But take this secret advice and do not plant your pointed wire in one go through the animal and onto the <m>plaster</m>, but having planted it, take it out of the <m>clay</m> earth & not out of the animal, & which is afterwards fastened there. One does this because by fastening the point the first time, it pushes in the skin of the serpent and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">When you reuse the points you have already used, make sure to clean them well of rust, so that they do not take away some skin.</div><div data-layout="bottom">The main arrangement of your casting is to keep its head very high & have it looking sideways.  For this effect, pierce the head on a solid plank or table <del>& <ill></del>, making the wire pass through the bottom of the throat up to the top of the head <br/></div><cont></div></folio></body></html>

Having cleaned it well, as is stated, and brushed it well, boil it in water with <m>curcuma root</m> or <m>terra merita</m>, and it will become very beautiful.</div></div><div id="p148r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Bleach</m></h2>
If it is for <m>silver</m>, do not grind your <m>tartar</m> with <sup>something made of</sup> <m>iron</m>, but with the handle of a hammer, because if you touch <x>your tartar with iron</x> and <x>end up</x> getting some <m>iron</m> in your <m>bleach</m>, the <m>silver</m> will come out red, like <m>copper</m>, and you will need to reheat it and put it back in the <m>bleach</m>.  Mix in nothing with your <m>tartar</m> that should not enter the <m>bleach</m>, because this ruins it. Do not let it spill out when it first starts to boil because all its strength is in it <x>at this point</x>.  <m>Bleach</m> is made with one part pulverized <m>tartar</m> and a half part of common <m>salt</m>.</div></div><div id="p148r_3"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Moulding the foot of the bittern, or eagle, or other birds for the base of saltcellars or vases</h2>
One commonly molds the foot and the legs up until the calf.  And for this effect, one molds it in five pieces: the leg in two pieces, the top of the foot in two, and the bottom in one piece.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">with three pieces</div> </div><div id="p148r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2><m>Crocum Ferri</m></h2>
To make this quickly, redden the <m>filings</m> in an <m>iron</m> ladle, stirring it often.  Then sprinkle it with some good <m>vinegar</m> and let it evaporate.  And without taking it away from above the fire, let it redden and take flame.  Having been cooled, pulverise <x>it</x> on the <m>marble</m> and return it to the heat, sprinkle with <m>vinegar</m>, and then set it on fire.  In this way it will soon be colored and made fine.</div>  </div></folio></body></html>

One usually paints them with oil colors, because distemper colors do not stay on. For marigold flowers, lightly ground minium for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a bit of massicot. For green, the vert-de-gris is dark and too somber. If it is a yellowish-green, you can mix with the vert-de-gris a bit of yellow ochre and scudegrum. If the green is dark, mix in some coals made from peach pits, which makes a greenish-black, in the same way than the bone of an ox foot bone makes a bluish-black. And in such a manner, by judgement and discretion, put the color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features of the work.</div></div><div id="p158v_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Large molds</h2>
Because of the heaviness of the metal, it is necessary to put them in a press so that they do not open.</div></div><div id="p158v_3"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Candle smoke</h2>
It allows the piece to be taken out more easily, and even if it is slightly thick, it does not stick because it has no substance. I have perfumed my core molds this way for tin and lead, and I have casted in a cold mold, but drying it well beforehand, and the piece came out quite cleanly. It is true that lead mixed with half the quantity of tin, because the medal was very thick, was very hot.</div></div><div id="p158v_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Casts</h2>
If the medal is very thick, do not pour a cast that is as thick; the cast just needs to be half as thick as the medal. But if it is thin, make a cast that is of the same thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the cast or the whole matter will fill with bubbles.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">Never forget to oil the cast with wax when you cast herbs or flowers, otherwise it will break and cannot be taken out.</div></div></folio></body></html>

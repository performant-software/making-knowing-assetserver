I took some fine <m>tin</m>, one lb., & one ounce of fine & new <m>lead</m>. I melted it in a crucible just until it was a bit red. Being in this way quite hot & ready to cast & no sooner, I smoked every side of my box frame with the smoke of a <m>tallow candle</m> & pressed & cast & everything. I set my box frame, well joined, in the press. I drew my crucible from the fire. I let it sit a bit to quench the redness of the crucible's bottom. And wanting to cast, I threw in around two or three grains of rosin, and about the measure of a bean of <m>looking-glass tin</m> & blended it & stirred the crucible a little and cast. And the medal came out as neat as the original. I smoked it with the candle & cleaned it with my <m>coat</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is lower, will come out better, and make the casting somewhat long. And when you cast several medals in a large box frame, they will come out better.</div></div><div id="p119r_1"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Notice about everything above</h2>
 Good <m>tin</m> is that which is hard as <m>silver</m> & soft nevertheless. If your work is fine, it must be almost all <m>tin</m> & alloyed as is said.</div><div data-layout="center"><m>Looking-glass tin</m> must not be mixed until the instant that you want to cast.</div><div data-layout="center"> Nor must the forms be smoked until then.</div><div data-layout="center"> If the <m>sand</m> shrinks in the box frame, this means that it must be reheated & turned red on the fire.</div><div data-layout="center">Good <m>sand</m> when moistened does not stick at all to the hand when pressed.</div><div data-layout="center">The perfect <m>sand</m> for the box frame is the <m>asphalt</m> found in Germany, which is soft as wet <m>flour</m>, & almost all the rest are lumpy.</div> <div data-layout="center"><rub>Nota</rub>that the casting must be fine & hardly thick so that it does not work the material at all, & must not exceed the thickness of a grain of <m>wheat</m> taken crossw-wise, likewise for <m>tin</m> that is going to be cast finely. For <m>lead</m>, a little thicker. There is no need to make air vents very large & deep either.</div><div data-layout="center">The <m>sand</m> that you use Ã  noyau for the said mixture is excellent for a box frame. But in washing, crushing & reheating it several times, its nature will be corrupted & it will no longer be fit to be taken & molded <pro>en noyau</pro>.</div></div></folio></body></html>

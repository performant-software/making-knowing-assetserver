And no matter which <m>turpentine</m> it may be, whether fine or coarse. One needs to give, as you know, a little fire at the beginning. And always keep <m>cold water</m> in the cooler on the top.

<m>Turpentine varnish</m> does not need any <m>glue</m> because it is fat and viscous and it is not absorbed in the <m>wood</m> like that of <m>spike lavender</m>  and <m>sandarac</m>. Also, that of<m>spike lavender</m> does not require any <m>glue</m> on <m>iron</m> & similar materials that do not absorb, but on <m>wood</m> and on colors which <del>have</del> <add>do not have</add> <m>gum</m> or <m><fr>colle de destrempe</fr></m>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said <m> <fr>colle de retailles</fr></m> & to let it dry & to varnish.</div></div></folio></body></html>

Take some <m>sublimate</m>, some <m>quicklime</m>, <m>soap from Venice</m>, some <m>horse manure</m>, use less <m>sublimate</m> than the other ingredients. Moisten all of them together, forming a paste and apply this to the <m>iron</m>, and wrap the whole thing in a dirty rag. Then reheat it until it becomes very red. Or leave it overnight in a good fire until the morning.  It will be very soft and you will be able to engrave whatever you wish on it.</div></div><div id="p149r_2"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Gold of lesser quality from <pl>Germany</pl>, <m>Electre</m></h2>
One calls it <m>gold</m> from the <pl>Rhine</pl>, which you can find in the rivers, and it comes in gold flakes. <pl>German</pl> <pro>goldsmiths</pro> wanted to refine it, thinking that they could separate it from the whitenes, which they thought was <m>silver</m>. But it always stayed white, which proves that this whiteness is fixed and it's only fault lies in its color. This is <m>electre</m>, from which you can make cups, which will reveal poison.</div></div><div id="p149r_3"><div data-layout="center"> <h2>Various arts from <pl>Germany</pl></h2>
They make great use of water mills, and most of these artisans working with <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, and any other metal, bring their large works to the mills to be hammered.  And to pull <m>iron thread</m>, they heat large amounts of <m>iron</m>, making it into a point, they hang it up still red, and very quickly pull it.</div></div><div id="p149r_4"><div data-layout="center"><h2>Repairing medals</h2>
If you want to mold any medal to use as a model, and at the same time repair it, cast it in a greater quantity of <m>tin</m>, and put in it a good amount of <m>tin alloy</m> to make it harder.</div></div>  </folio></body></html>

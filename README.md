Making and Knowing Asset Server
================

The server periodically retrieves and updates content in DOCX form from the google drive share, it then converts it to .html and serves it in a known structure as an API for the M+K front end.

To get an individual folio:
```
Format:  
[your domain]/folio/[id]/[tc|tcn|tl]/

Example:  
http://209.97.145.244/folio/p001v/tcn
```

Visit the following to see the status of the import:  
```
[your domain]/import_status.html
```

Setup
-----
1. You will need to set up and configure [rclone](https://rclone.org/) which provides rsync-like functionality. Set up rclone to have a destination called 'google' which is authorized to access the share. On my mac with homebrew and interactive session:  
```
brew install rclone  
rclone config
```

2. Next, install the Javascript dependencies in the scripts/content_import directory:
```
cd scripts/content_import
yarn install

3. Install the pm2 process manager: 
```
cd ../..
yarn global add pm2

4. Start the process manager from the base directory of the project:

pm2 start

Setup Notes
------------

To make the process manager automatically restart on system start:

```
pm2 startup

To undo this:

````
pm2 unstartup systemd

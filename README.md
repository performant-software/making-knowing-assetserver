- You might need [go](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.10.darwin-amd64.tar.gz#uninstall) if you don't have it.

- You will need the [google drive client](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive) 'drive' (written in go):  
```go get -u github.com/odeke-em/drive/cmd/drive```

- You will need 'recode' for entity decoding:  
```brew install recode```

- Set up the drive client:
drive init ~/gdrive
